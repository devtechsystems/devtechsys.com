Dr. Mark Gallagher is an industry leader in PFM with 34 years of experience working in more than two dozen countries in Asia, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Central Europe, and nine times as a USAID Chief of Party (COP)/Team Leader for economic and fiscal reform projects. Dr. Gallagher joined our office as the Director of Public Finance, COP for USAID/FAST, and the Project Director for USAID/EGSA, but he is not new to DevTech as he worked here from 1998 to 2001. As COP on two global fiscal task orders, heâ€™s managed activities around the world, including India and Vietnam; he directly implemented capacity building projects in Bangladesh, Vietnam, Philippines, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Lao. He has developed and taught PFM-related courses, such as in CBA at Columbia University, and has mentored and coached policymakers and technical staff at ministries, as well as helped write PFM legislation (e.g. for tax policy in Bosnia and macro-fiscal modeling in Lao PDR) and served as a trusted advisor to policymakers, for example in El Salvador.
