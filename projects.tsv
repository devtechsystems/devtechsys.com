DevTech technical experts developed complete automation plans, full systemization design and architecture, database development, and data processing centralization. In addition, DevTech completed an assessment of the legal framework for tax administration and tax policy, and established a system to ensure that future necessary legal reforms will be defined in a way that will help to facilitate further reform.All tasks were completed on time and within scope. In addition to the original scope of work, USAID asked TAMP to support the immediate implementation of the Taxpayer Registration system.	http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pdach965.pdf	Bosnia and Herzegovina: USAID assistance in tax modernization	No	Public Financial Management and Fiscal Sustainability	Tax-Administration-Modernization-Project-(TAMP):-Phase-I
