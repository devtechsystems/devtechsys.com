The result was a detailed chart of accounts that accommodated both the budgetary and accounting processes for the central government, decentralized agencies, and public enterprises.In the second element of the project, DevTech performed an in-depth analysis of the accounting systems used by the Treasury, the Accountant General, several public enterprises, the Secretariats of Budget, Public Debt, and Decentralized Agencies, and the Data Processing Center.

43	Guinea Rural Roads	1993	1996	GIN	Africa	Guinea	USAID	x	x	The study finds that the impact of rural roads on agricultural markets and marketing activities, a strategic objective of the PNIR project, is considerable. Over the last three years, marketing traffic has increased six fold, while the number of people in markets, the number of commercial vehicle operators, and the number of traders have all more than doubled. The number of tax tickets levied on markets has increased threefold, which clearly indicates an increase in the number of commercial transactions. The volume of agricultural products sold in markets has increased fivefold, and transportation time has decreased to one-sixth of what it was, since the average speed on improved roads has increased from 6 kilometers per hour (kdh) to 35 kdh. As a result, transportation costs have been cut in half for passengers as well as for commodities, and traffic is no longer halted during the rainy season. Villages that were totally cut off are now linked to the outside world year-round.

94	The Future of Education in the Dominican Republic: Opportunities and Challenges	2000	2000	DOM	Latin America and the Caribbean	Dominican Republic	USAID	x		Instead of an evaluation of the PDE, the work was conducted as an analysis of the evolutionof the PDE to identify its achievements and strengths as well as its shortfalls and weaknessesand apply this experience in the design and implementation of future actions. The focus onthe PDE is a methodological recourse that allows a great deal of specificity in the analysis ofthe contributing factors and obstacles encountered in the implementation of the PDE and theformulation of implications and recommendations, thus avoiding generalities of little or novalue for future policy choices. In the end, however, we believe our contribution should notbe limited to an evaluation of the PDE as process. Thus, while we use an analysis of the PDEas a methodological recourse, and we do make certain “process” suggestions, we also makesome recommendations regarding the substantive nature of the reforms that are needed.In order to carry out a profound analysis of the roots of the educational problems that havebeen affecting the Dominican Republic for many years, we applied an eclectic methodologicalapproach that combines traditional empirical analysis with personal accounts of the mostimportant events and conditions. Without the latter element of investigation, albeit informal,we would fall into the trap of a superficial and perfunctory analysis, leaving some criticallyrelevant issues out of the picture simply because they could be controversial, a practice notacceptable in DevTech’s consulting ethics. Unfortunately, the history of public education inDominican Republic is plagued by decisions and activities that are not entirely transparent tothe general public and are conveniently omitted from the analysis of the pusillanimousinvestigator.

96	Support for Economic Growth and Fiscal Reform	2001	2004	UKR	Europe and Eurasia	Ukraine	USAID		x	DevTech provided resident, long-term technical assistance on budget reform and institutional strengthening in Ukraine.The project had two phases.Phase IDuring the first 18 months, DevTech assisted the Ministry of Finance to reform its budget process. DevTech provided a Budget Advisor, who helped the Ministry of Finance design and incorporate policies, procedures, and programs that ensured all government ministries develop and execute balanced budgets that reflected their respective short-, medium- and long-term strategies, priorities, and objectives. The Budget Advisor trained various line-ministries and conducted strategic planning while helping to build the capacity of the ministries’ staff with regards to program or performance based budgeting (PPB). DevTech also helped the Ministry of Finance to establish a more effective revenue and expenditures structure that was consistent with the new market economy driven government functions.Phase IIIn 2003, the project shifted focus from federal ministries to the sub-national level. DevTech began promoting fiscal decentralization and equitable allocation of resources, and trained local officials to increase their budgeting and financial management expertise and capabilities. The Senior Budget Advisor, based in Khmelnitsky, became Chief of Party. As such, he assisted local governments in Lviv and Poltava to improve their financial position through PPB, resulting in more autonomy and accountability. DevTech led a nationwide budget training to raion and subraion finance officers, focusing on the opportunities and requirements mandated in Ukraine’s new Budget Code. Three oblasts and their cooperating jurisdictions used PPB for their 2005–2007 budgets, thus demonstrating a capacity to implement improved budgeting approaches. They were then selected to participate in an intense training program with seminars, workshops, and mini-trainings, which served as a PPB Pilot Project to be replicated on a wider scale. DevTech also provided critical technical input into the extension of the Budget Code to lower levels of local government, specifically to subraion levels.

104	Assessment of USAID Civil Society Program in the Dominican Republic	2001	2002	DOM	Latin America and the Caribbean	Dominican Republic	USAID	x		"DevTech led a team of evaluation and civil society specialists with extensive knowledge of the Dominican Republic to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the impact of USAID's Strengthening Civil Society Project, which included the Democratic Initiative Project (PID), providing substantial resources to Participación Ciudadana (PC), and supporting Rule of Law activities related to civil society through Fundación Institucionalidad y Justicia (FINJUS).The objectives of the assessment were to provide a rigorous review of the impact of USAID's investment in civil society; share input to help the Mission shape its next five-year strategy (2002—2007); and draw key lessons learned and best practices from USAID/DR's activities to promote the development of a politically active civil society in support of democracy.As part of this assessment, the team:Interviewed 187 key individuals in local and national government using semi-structured protocols;Conducted 22 focus groups throughout the country with PID sub-grantees and PC electoral observers;Conducted a nationwide survey of PID beneficiaries and PC electoral observers on values and practices of individuals and community groups related to democracy and civil society. The data from the nation-wide survey was then cross-analyzed to draw conclusions about the impact of program activities.The Assessment team concluded that there were several key factors critical to the success of implementing a program to strengthen civil society in the Dominican Republic. These were:Civil Society Programs require a long-term strategy. USAID/DR's foresight to support the initiative over a 10-year period was critical. It provided the necessary time to build the projects carefully, let them take hold, and eventually reach out to a broad and receptive public. Changing political culture needs at least a decade.One step behind approach is critical. An essential part of the strategy to promote democracy in the DR was to maintain a low profile, allowing the Dominican grantees to take the visible lead in pushing for democratic reforms. This one step behind strategy conferred legitimacy and credibility to the effort as a Dominican initiative and was key to its success.Flexibility. Given the fluidity of the political situation in the DR, it was essential for the USAID Mission to support a \""demand\"" rather than a \""supply\"" driven initiative. This approach helped to build momentum and contributed to the sustainability of the initiative"	Office	checchi@checchiconsulting.com	202-466-9070	No	Monitoring and Evaluation	Assessment-of-USAID-Civil-Soci	Checchi and Company Consulting	168147.00	AEP-I-00-00-00022-00	x			https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?q=KERvY3VtZW50cy5JbnN0aXR1dGlvbl9vcl9VU0FJRF9CdXJlYXVfQXV0aG9yOigoIjAwNTkzMSAtIERldmVsb3BtZW50IFRlY2hub2xvZ2llcywgSW5jLiAoRGV2VGVjaCkiKSBPUiAoIjAwOTA1NCAtIERldlRlY2ggU3lzdGVtcywgSW5jLiIpKSk=&ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MjY2NjEz&qcf=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&ph=VHJ1ZQ==&bckToL=VHJ1ZQ==&		Assessment of USAID civil Society programs in the Dominican Republic

The BPS Project's goal was to help the GFRN solidify institutional roles in the budget preparation process and establish a multi-year budgeting capability. The project provided technical assistance and training in the areas of planning processes, budget preparation and formulation, budget execution, and organizational development. DevTech provided technical assistance in organizational development to the Budget Office of the Federation (BOF) in the Ministry of Finance and to the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence (BMPI) Unit of the Office of the President.The BOF was divided into several departments that had historically functioned as separate entities, with little understanding or incentive for aligning each department under a unifying overall objective, resulting in inefficiency, mismanagement, and unclear roles. Thus, DevTech conducted a participatory analysis of the departments, and then helped them to clearly define their respective roles in the budget process regarding the overall BOF strategic plan. Following this exercise, DevTech helped BOF staff develop departmental objectives that were in alignment with the overall BOF objectives, with measurable performance indicators built into each objective. DevTech staff also provided input into the development of a training program.The BMPI unit was responsible for ensuring that the Office of the President was fully informed about the budgetary process at three levels:Budget Formulation—providing a pool of experts and a Price Intelligence Database (PID) tool to ensure accuracy and authenticity of expenditure proposals submitted by various governmental units;Budget Prioritization—establishing the strategic and planning priorities for future allocation of resources; andBudget Execution—enhancing the efficiency and the effectiveness of programs and service delivery as well as the overall management of resources.The BMPI Unit's staff members were mostly contract hires and the BMPI Unit Director planned to have these positions and these staff \""regularized\"" into the civil service, as full-time staff.To help the BMPI Unit achieve its goals, DevTech assessed consultants' contracts and assisted with planning for the transition of consultancies to full-time staff. DevTech staff reviewed the consultants' perceptions regarding their work with the BMPI vis-à-vis their career development targets; identified factors that inhibit and stimulate the staff in their current roles, and incentives that would make employment more attractive; and provided a methodology to regularize the consulting staff of the BMPI within the civil service structure, upon full-time enrollment. DevTech also conducted an evaluation of existing skills of personnel and identified additional skills required of sector specialists and training needs; helped BMPI staff define personnel job descriptions and create a nomenclature of compensation; identified ways to attract additional expertise into the BMPI Unit; identified a transition strategy for departing staff (sector specialists) and new hires; defined recruitment procedures for new hires; and reviewed and developed organizational performance, standards of performance, appraisal, and teamwork."

117	Fiscal Policy Reform: Guatemalan Municipal Tax Code	2002	2002	GTM	Latin America and the Caribbean	Guatemala	USAID	x	x	The cost incurred by the Superintendency of Tax Administration (SAT) in all aspects covered by the administration of the taxes that it administers is of fiscal, economic and social interest, since these costs represent a deduction of the gross yield of each tax. It is therefore important to make an effort to minimize this cost - without undermining the related efforts to strengthen tax collection.Simultaneously, the administrative cost estimate can play two additional roles:• Identify those taxes whose cost represents a relatively high proportion of their gross receipts; If so, it may be advisable or repeal such tribute or modify it so that its net collection increased.• Allow international comparisons as a useful tool for tax administrators and for those who forge tax policy, thus pointing to areas where administrative efficiency is needed.

118	U.S.-Mexico Partnership for Municipal Development	2002	2003	MEX	Latin America and the Caribbean	Mexico	USAID	x	x	In an effort to foster fiscal decentralization in the Government of Mexico, DevTech, under contract to ICMA, provided strategic support to the Fiscal Coordination Commission. DevTech sought to enable the Commission to become the key forum for dialogue on fiscal decentralization and to develop concrete proposals for changes and/or improvements to existing laws and policies that the Commission can take to the Mexican National Congress for approval. These efforts helped the Commission better articulate the demand for fiscal decentralization in the country and develop specific initiatives to reform/improve upon existing laws, regulations, and practices.As part of this effort, DevTech:>Assessed the state of intergovernmental relations, including distribution of revenues, spending, etc., and the legal framework for the federal and state constitutions and local government law;>Trained members of the Commission in transfer systems, assignment of roles and responsibilities, service delivery models and best practices based on international experience;>Designed and supervised a variety of technical studies; and>Organized a seminar to review these studies and to arrive at a consensus on the future of fiscal federalism.DevTech helped the Instituto para el Desarrollo Técnico de las Haciendas Públicas (INDETEC) publish these studies in a single volume book titled: Enfoques Alternativos del Federalismo Fiscal en México (Alternative Foci for Fiscal Federalism in Mexico).This final work represented a broad consensus for reform, endorsed by the major players, but based on solid technical analysis. The broad distribution and discussion of this book helped ensure that these issues would start to rise to the top of the political and legislative agenda.	C.P.

119	Accelerated Microenterprise Advancement Project	2002	2006	GTM	Latin America and the Caribbean	Guatemala	USAID	x		DevTech deployed a team that used in-depth field interviews and a survey of buyers and producers, to take a “bottom-up” perspective to investigate the nature, determinants, and consequences of MSE participation in the textile handicrafts and high-value horticulture value chains in Guatemala. The evaluation team empirically tested the characteristics of value chain linkages that facilitate or inhibit the formation of collaborative inter-firm relationships, both vertically (between firms at different levels of the value chain) and horizontally (among firms at the same level of the value chain). This was followed by an analysis of the impact of these vertical and horizontal relationships on MSE owners’ ability to innovate, or upgrade, their enterprise. The results indicated the importance of market information, inter-firm communication, reduced transaction costs, risk-offsetting opportunities, and effective group governance in building strong horizontal and vertical relationships that promote MSE upgrading and enhance the competitiveness of value chains.

149	Guatemala Decentralization and Local Governance	2005	2009	GTM	Latin America and the Caribbean	Guatemala	USAID			DevTech was the prime contractor on USAID's Decentralization and Local Governance program in Guatemala. DevTech provided technical assistance in municipalities and coordinated assistance for national-level institutions to improve the capacity to support decentralization. In two cases, contract results were modified mid-course due to changes in Government of Guatemala requirements for municipalities. DevTech conducted the necessary technical analysis to adjust the program activities and re-target assistance. DevTech also helped the Governor of the San Marcos Department establish a system for municipalities to implement reconstruction activities and monitor reconstruction projects in the aftermath of Hurricane Stan.DevTech incorporated an integrated performance monitoring system for its work at the local government level, which includes indicators for more than 20 lower-level results, and data collection (baseline and yearly) in 15 municipalities. The system served as a basis for establishing indicators of municipal development and guided program activities.The Program had four Sub-Intermediate Results (IR):Sub-IR 2.1 More transparent systems for management of public resources by local governmentsSub-IR 2.2 Increased devolution of responsibilities and resources to the local level resulting in greater responsiveness by local governments to citizens' needsSub-IR 2.3 More opportunities for citizen participation in and oversight of local government decision-makingSub-IR 2.4 Local capacity for the development and implementation of reconstruction program strengthened in the San Marcos Department.  Sub-IR 2.1. More Transparent Systems for Management of Public ResourcesThis Sub-IR indicator measured the improvement in the fiscal performance of the selected municipalities. For the 13 selected Program municipalities, intergovernmental transfers were, on average, 92 percent of total revenues in 2008. The annual rate of growth of own-source revenues for the 13 selected municipalities increased from -0.5 percent in 2005 to 41.2 percent in 2008. Technical assistance was delivered through three mechanisms:Updating the municipal fees schedules;Improving operating regulations and collection of fees for municipal services; andStrengthening policies to reduce the avoidance of the payment of municipal servicesIn addition to the improvement in revenue collection, the Program successfully strengthened the public financial management systems at the municipal level. These included a public procurement system, financial management system, auditing units, and internal controls. In the base year of 2005, the average score for the 13 municipalities was 31 out of 100 points. When the Program closed in September 2009, the average had increased to 89 out of 100 points.Sub-IR 2.2. Increased devolution of responsibilities and greater responsiveness to citizen needs The focus of the activities in this Sub-IR was to change the dynamics at the national level for decentralization. The Program:Developed a proposal for a municipal tax code and a municipal code;Introduced a solution for the problem of municipal debt;Designed a Single-Window for Municipal Projects as the mechanism to improve the coordination of national and municipal public investment; andProvided legal assistance for the revision of the statutes of national-level municipal associations to reform their reform its governance structure. Sub-IR 2.3. More opportunities for citizen participation in and oversight of local government decision-makingThe indicator for Sub-IR 2.3 was defined as: “Number of Municipalities with Municipal Development Council (COMUDE) Citizen Participation Commissions operating”. Although the target was seven (7) COMUDEs, by the end of the Program 10 COMUDEs had been established and were functioning with the appropriate commissions and committees. Those formed included the participation of municipal authorities and community leaders. These commissions monitored the commitments made by the COMUDE. In addition, the commissions were conceived as a space to improve the quality, not only the number, of women participating. The Program experience suggests that women participate more actively in small groups. Over the course of the four years of field implementation, a total of 22,744 persons participated in training workshops, COMUDEs, and Commissions (not exclusive to Citizen Participation). Of this total, 24.8 percent were women.Sub-IR 2.4. Local capacity for the development and implementation of reconstruction program strengthened in the San Marcos Department.At the request of USAID, Sub-IR 2.4 was added to the Program to contribute to the reconstruction process in the Department of San Marcos in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Stan. In the aftermath of Hurricane Stan, DevTech provided technical assistance during a two-year period to 14 municipalities as well as the governor’s office to track and manage rehabilitation projects to ensure their completion, and strengthen the Municipal Planning Offices and COMUDES to take a pro-active role in the process. A tangible outcome was the design of an easy-to-use management information system for monitoring infrastructure projects that can be used at the municipal levels. The Program has worked with the Secretariat of Decentralization (SCEP) to establish a one-stop window for processing municipal investment projects, and also worked with SCEP and Executive Secretariat of Planning and Programming to replicate the program as a model across the country.

161	Strengthen the Capacity of the Accountant General of the Federation of Nigeria	2007	2008	NGA	Africa	Nigeria	USAID		x	This project sought to build the capacity of the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (AGF) and Auditor General's Office (AGO) to use an electronic Transaction Recording and Reporting System (TRRS) developed with assistance from the World Bank and IMF. At the beginning of the project, 51 of the 105 government ministries, departments, and agencies and none of the federal payroll offices were using the TRRS to submit timely accounts. The project aimed to change the business practices of branches of the federal government so they would integrate the TRRS into their operations, strengthening the capacity of the AGF to complete the consolidation of accounting information from all Ministries and agencies in a timely manner, and ensuring that consolidated data was used to perform real-time audits. Trainings enhanced accountants’ capacity to enter information into the TRRS and auditors’ capacity both in the AGF and AGO to perform real-time audits of government agencies, offices, aid Ministries.As part of this initiative, DevTech developed an organizational change management (OCM) strategy for the TRRS, and worked with other project team members to implement it. The purpose of the OCM strategy was to ensure that all system users were fully aware of the changes taking place as a result of the new system, and understood their respective roles in the organization.

Espacios para Crecer (EpC) was developed under the DOL-funded project Combating Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic (2003-2007) and Espacios para Emprender (EpE) under the new DOL-funded project Combating Exploitative Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic (2007-2011) in the Dominican Republic.In Colombia, the project worked to withdraw or prevent more than 10,000 Colombian children and adolescents from engaging in exploitative child labor by delivering educational opportunities, implementing strategies to raise awareness about the child labor problem, and supporting the improvement of education and child labor policies. The project worked in the most conflictive and poorest barrios of Bogotá, Cali, Cartagena, Barranquilla and Santa Marta, and in poor rural areas of the provinces of Santander and Boyacá where armed conflict has been a way of life during the past few decades.The EpC and EpE programs focus on children who are involved in the worst forms of child labor: commercial sexual exploitation, street sales (ranging from food to drugs), carrying heavy packages in market areas, work in small machine shops, work in agriculture with dangerous tools and toxic substances. The programs have enabled children and adolescents to improve their self-image, gain valuable social and academic skills and as a result attend school regularly and improve their academic performance.

ALP was developed in 1998 with the goal of meeting the educational needs of primary school drop-outs and over-aged children and youth, by enabling them to complete their primary education in three years (Levels 1-III vs. Grades 1-6). At the time of the evaluation, the ALP was implemented in 10 counties by 11 implementing partners.The Evaluation Team dedicated three months in Liberia to assess:The coverage and impact of the USAID-funded ALPP intervention after 18 months of implementation; andThe relative efficacy and appropriateness of the overall ALP model for students aged 15 and older as implemented by the 11 partner agencies.The evaluation design included classroom observations, focus groups, and student testing.The Evaluation Team traveled to the six counties where ALPP was implemented, visiting a total of 18 school sites and covering the educational programs of the USAID-implemented ALPP, Partner-implemented ALPs, and MoE-run Conventional Primary School Grades 1-6. Data was collected through 39 classroom observations as well as focus groups/interviews that were carried out with a number of stakeholders, which included: Ministry of Education personnel, partner organizations, County and District Education Officers, principals, community members, Parent-Teacher Associations, youth groups and students.To assess the learning outcomes of ALP students and determine the overall effectiveness of the program, the Team developed and administered assessment instruments in Mathematics and Language Arts for ALP Levels II and III. The exams were designed to assess proficiency in specific skills such as subtraction, division, use of pronouns, and comprehension. To provide comparative data, the tests were also administered to students in MoE Grades 3 and 5 and to students in ALP partner programs. In total, 806 students were tested by the DevTech team.To complement the evaluation aspects of the assignment, DevTech delivered three capacity building workshops to staff of the implementing partners and other Liberian educators.  The purpose was to increase the capacity of ALP Implementing Partners to develop instructional assessments to collect and use data on ALP student learning outcomes to improve the ability to collect, manage, and analyze data through improved database skills, and to develop a common monitoring tool and reliable database for ALP/ALPP programs.

220	Evaluation of OFDA's ICS in EAP	2016	2017	PHL, IDN, THA	Asia	Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand	USAID	x		This project was a performance evaluation of the Incident Command System (ICS) program in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand managed by the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA). The evaluation examined the program’s effectiveness and sustainability in building the capacity of local government agencies in the three countries to respond to natural disaster using ICS. The evaluation applied a mixed methods design, collecting data from document reviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and an online survey for ICS master trainers in the Philippines. Results show that the programs have identified the appropriate local government agencies to work with and ICS capacities are being built to varying degrees. Demand for training is high but USAID/OFDA and the United States Forest Service (USFS) trainers must consider contextualizing ICS principles and training content to make the system relevant to local agencies and communities. USAID/OFDA and USFS trainers also should consider conditions unique to each country, such as governance structures, to solicit the support of the local first responders’ community. The effectiveness and sustainability will also be better understood if local government agencies develop performance management plans to track the program’s effectiveness and sustainability.

224	Public Opinion Survey Evaluation of Zimbabwe Public Awareness Project and Midline Evaluation of U.S.-Ghana Child Protection Compact Partnership	2017	2018	GHA, ZWE	Africa	Ghana, Zimbabwe	U.S. Department of State	x		The purpose of the evaluation activity in Zimbabwe – as it is not an evaluation per se, but sets the methodological framework for one – is thus to design an impact evaluation methodology that enables DoS to answer the evaluation questions stated in the Statement of Work (SoW) on the effectiveness of various types of public awareness campaigns on TIP issues and risk factors among targeted communities in Zimbabwe, with a focus on the enhanced capacity of these communities to prevent TIP. This will be completed through a public opinion survey of approximately 1,000 Zimbabweans.The midline performance evaluation of the project in Ghana will determine the extent to which the CPC Partnership model has improved the Ghanaian Government’s response to child trafficking in Ghana, considering the three fundamental anti-trafficking strategies – prosecuting traffickers, protecting victims, and preventing trafficking – as well as coordination. This midline evaluation builds on the two comprehensive, J/TIP -funded baseline assessments conducted on child trafficking in Ghana – the assessment of the state of child trafficking in Ghana, conducted by Westat, and the Nordic Consulting Group Denmark A/S and JMK Consulting of Ghana baseline report on FTS’ Growing Up Free program in Volta and Central regions in Ghana.
