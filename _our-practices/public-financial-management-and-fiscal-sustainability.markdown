DevTech has modernized government systems around the world in order to create more transparent and efficient financial and fiscal policies. From decentralizing fiscal systems to establishing performance based budgeting and medium term expenditure frameworks, our projects have produced sound economic and fiscal policies around the world. Our assistance to local and national governments has included the creation of market intelligence and competitiveness units to foster small and medium enterprise (SME) participation in international markets, as well as supporting foreign ministries of finance to improve and modernize tax policy and administration.

Our analytical expertise also informs several economic and social databases that supply essential information to governments and development professionals worldwide. This includes congressionally mandated reports that outline foreign assistance spending for the US Government, effectively advancing open data and transparency goals for our own government.
