DevTech has successfully managed more than 150 monitoring and evaluation activities in more than 100 countries across complicated socioeconomic contexts and non-permissive environments, including conflict and post-conflict areas. Our breadth of experience includes conducting multi-country and multi-sector evaluations (including baseline, mid-term, and final evaluation data collection), performance evaluations, results frameworks, evaluation technical assistance, and training. All of our work is grounded in sound quantitative and qualitative research methods.

Our rich monitoring and evaluation capabilities are evidenced in our award-winning, field-tested performance monitoring, evaluation, and learning solutions. The practice builds upon firm-wide expertise in agriculture, democracy and governance, economic growth, education, environment, gender, and more.  We have experience working with USAID and other partners to analyze data quality, design and manage user-friendly information systems, oversee data collection, and track changes attributable to assistance interventions. Our work facilitates program management decisions to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of projects and programs.
