The gender assessment was carried out by an expat and a local gender expert to provide the Mission with an overview of gender issues to be taken into account in new programs and in the planning for the country strategy. The SOW also requested a review of gender integration in current activities. This was the second USAID/ES gender assessment under the task order. Unfortunately, the consultants found little carry over from the assessment done five years earlier, which had generated not only recommendations and an action plan but also a gender working group and a Gender Mission Order. The three program areas were EG (including environment), Investing in People (health, education, youth at risk), and DG. The assessment team also conducted two two-hour training sessions, one for Mission staff and one for implementing partners.
