  The Global Technology Network (GTN) contract expanded on DevTech's experience
  in developing and managing the environmental technology network for
  USAID/US-AEP. The primary objective of the GTN was to identify, disseminate

  businesses interested in emerging markets. The GTN assisted lesser-developed
  countries (LDCs) countries graduating from USAID development assistance, and
  U.S. small and medium-size businesses to effectively respond to economic
  policy reforms and ensure sustainable economic growth through trade. DevTech's
  GTN staff provided assistance to companies operating in such industries as
  health, agri-business, financial services, telecommunications, and information
  technology.
