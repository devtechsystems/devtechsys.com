Project Title: Education Reform Evaluation in the Dominican Republic
Start Year: '2000'
End Year: '2000'
ISO3 Code: DOM
Region: Latin America and the Caribbean
Country: Dominican Republic
Client/ Donor: USAID
Brief Discription: >-
  In 1990, the Dominican Republic embarked on a process of basic education
  reform with the consensus of civil society organizations and the Government of
  the Dominican Republic. The debates led to a comprehensive 10-year reform
  plan—the Plan Decenal—begun in 1992.Through a task order under the Evaluation
  IQC, DevTech conducted an external evaluation of the Plan Decenal's
  achievements. The evaluation's main goal was to provide guidelines for a new
  stage of the reform process. DevTech presented an objective and critical
  assessment of the reforms in order to involve all sectors of the Dominican
  population in the development of a second Plan Decenal. The evaluation found
  that, while the education sector continued to suffer from under-development,
  there was promise in public-private partnerships in the education sector. The
  evaluation identified eight principles for educational reform:Principle No. 1:
  Education cannot be improved by trying to change everything at the same time.
  A feasible reform program (vis-à-vis the theoretically optimal one) should
  concentrate on achieving a few critical goals and advance from there in
  successive stages.Principle No. 2: Education reform with the depth the
  Dominican Republic needs cannot be achieved during the tenure of one
  government administration. In fact, the necessary changes may require the
  consistent effort of several administrations from different political parties.
  That is why a successful reform program must be non-partisan and
  consensus-driven, though we are strongly of the opinion that a consensus base
  is not enough; the reform also has to be sensible (e.g., it cannot assume the
  equivalent of the Earth being flat).Principle No. 3: Good management does not
  come from authority, political power, or hierarchy. Good management is an
  advanced skill and cannot be improvised or achieve by appointing trusted
  aides. Education reform is a highly complex and involved process that requires
  top quality managers. If they are not available, it should be imported on the
  same basis that technical assistance and external resources are being brought
  from external sources.Principle No. 4: Reform goals must be achievable with
  the resources currently available under a hard budget constraint. If those
  targets are below what the Dominican economy and society at large require,
  more resources must be made available. If the targets overshoot their
  possibilities, they will contribute to disorganize the effort and make it
  fail.Principle No. 5: As a corollary to Principle 1, a given improvement of a
  reform program cannot be implemented equally in all institutions at the same
  time. As the reform effort advances, there will be inequalities of
  implementation simply because some agents are more skillful than others, but
  this should not be an impediment to the advance of the reforms.Principle No.
  6: At least some of the proposed solutions should ideally be administratively
  feasible in the Dominican Republic, by the Dominican state, as it exists
  today. It should not be necessary to assume a state that is more
  administratively capable than currently exists, in order to implement all of
  the project’s points. Some points in the project should be implementable even
  if there is no improvement whatever in the administrative capacity of the
  state.Principle No. 7: One should start from the final goal and reason back.
  The final goal is for children to have more access to schooling and to learn
  more. Everything else is an intermediate goal.Principle No. 8: Improving
  capacity (e.g., improving capacity of principals to manage, or teachers to
  teach), without creating accountability mechanisms to create incentives to use
  that capacity is largely useless unless one is willing to make the
  unwarrantedly romantic assumption that teachers and principals will work hard
  and, just for love of the craft. However, to create accountability pressure
  mechanisms without also expanding the personal and institutional supply
  capacity is also largely useless since there is nothing with which to respond
  to the accountability pressure.The end product of DevTech's technical
  assistance served as input for a strategic planning exercise that the future
  Minister had requested and consisted of an initial diagnosis, policies and
  strategies, provincial planning, and pilot project design.The evaluation was
  widely cited at the time and utilized as a key input into the planning process
  of the government.
