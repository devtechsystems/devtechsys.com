Project Title: Health Care and Social Security
Start Year: '1987'
End Year: '1988'
ISO3 Code:
- COS
Region: Latin America and the Caribbean
Country: Costa Rica
Client/ Donor: World Bank
Brief Description: As part of a World Bank Technical Assistance Loan for structural
  adjustment, DevTech assessed various aspects of the public health care system and
  the pension regimes of Costa Rica. DevTech evaluated the internal efficiency of
  the health care system, its long-term economic and financial viability, alternatives
  for improving outpatient services, and the integration of preventive and curative
  services. One of the objectives was to study the possibility of increasing the role
  of preventive rather than curative services to reduce the overall costs of the national
  health care system. The project included formulation of a quantitative model of
  health planning aimed at simulating and projecting future resource needs (derived
  from epidemiological transitions and improvements in managerial conditions). DevTech's
  team of consultants for this aspect of the project included experts in macroeconomics
  and microeconomics, sociology, public health, epidemiology, institutional analysis,
  and statistical and quantitative analysis. In the area of social security, DevTech
  examined the financial viability of the various pension regimes, their impact on
  the national budget, the feasibility of integrating them, and political alternatives
  aimed at lessening the fiscal burden the country was facing.
