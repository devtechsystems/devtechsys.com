Project Title: Public Opinion Survey Evaluation of Zimbabwe Public Awareness Project
  and Midline Evaluation of U.S.-Ghana Child Protection Compact Partnership
Start Year: '2017'
End Year: '2018'
ISO3 Code:
- GHA
- ZWE
Region: Africa
Country: Ghana, Zimbabwe
Client/ Donor: U.S. Department of State
Brief Description: The purpose of the evaluation activity in Zimbabwe – as it is not
  an evaluation per se, but sets the methodological framework for one – is thus to
  design an impact evaluation methodology that enables DoS to answer the evaluation
  questions stated in the Statement of Work (SoW) on the effectiveness of various
  types of public awareness campaigns on TIP issues and risk factors among targeted
  communities in Zimbabwe, with a focus on the enhanced capacity of these communities
  to prevent TIP. This will be completed through a public opinion survey of approximately
  1,000 Zimbabweans.The midline performance evaluation of the project in Ghana will
  determine the extent to which the CPC Partnership model has improved the Ghanaian
  Government’s response to child trafficking in Ghana, considering the three fundamental
  anti-trafficking strategies – prosecuting traffickers, protecting victims, and preventing
  trafficking – as well as coordination. This midline evaluation builds on the two
  comprehensive, J/TIP -funded baseline assessments conducted on child trafficking
  in Ghana – the assessment of the state of child trafficking in Ghana, conducted
  by Westat, and the Nordic Consulting Group Denmark A/S and JMK Consulting of Ghana
  baseline report on FTS’ Growing Up Free program in Volta and Central regions in
  Ghana.
