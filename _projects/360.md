This was a one-year activity. Three-day gender mainstreaming workshops were held in each country. An international gender consultant led the workshops, and three national gender consultants provided background papers on gender in their countries and co-facilitated the workshops. The workshops had a set of common objectives: to develop a common understanding of gender mainstreaming in WAWI, to establish a commitment to modify current practices to assure gender mainstreaming, and to prepare recommendations for next steps. Recommendations from the workshop led to a new gender mainstreaming activity (funded through the USAID EGAT/WID Office), which developed a year long program to create national level gender working groups, provide technical assistance on gender to WAWI partners, and hold a gender mainstreaming implementation workshop.
