description: >-
  DevTech advised the Government of Montenegro on reform of legislation on the
  powers and functions of local governments and the development of a more
  efficient, equitable system of intergovernmental finance in Montenegro. This
  included reviewing and analyzing existing laws governing municipal and
  intergovernmental finance systems, including the laws on Self-Government,
  Public Expenditures, and Public Revenues, advising on draft legislation, and
  ensuring that the new legislation addressed the interests and needs of
  municipal governments. The advisory service focused on conducting an analysis
  of social equity and fiscal efficiency impacts of existing revenue and
  expenditure assignment systems, tax sharing, and grant policies, and
  developing recommendations for improvements based on their effects on local
  governments. In addition, DevTech completed an analysis of the property tax
  and assisted in the development of a new property tax law and system.
  DevTech's work included analysis, advice, and public information for reforms.
