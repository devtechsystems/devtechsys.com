DevTech carried out a diagnosis of the Honduran financial accounting system and recommended a strategy and implementation plan to standardize accounts and improve the manner in which information for those accounts is collected, maintained, and used. This effort included a definition of the roles of the various entities within SECPLAN (Planning Ministry), MHYCP (Ministry of Finance and Public Credit), and BCH (Central Bank of Honduras) with regards to the budgetary process and the requirements of each institution in terms of timely and useful consolidated financial information. A two-person team performed the diagnosis and analysis on-site in Honduras and produced a report that included an implementation plan for technical assistance.
