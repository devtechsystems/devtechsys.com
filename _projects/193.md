In 1990, the Dominican Republic embarked on a process of basic education reform with the consensus of civil society organizations and the Government of the Dominican Republic. The debates led to a comprehensive 10-year reform plan—the Plan Decenal—begun in 1992. Through a task order under the Evaluation IQC, DevTech conducted an external evaluation of the Plan Decenal's achievements. The evaluation's main goal was to provide guidelines for a new stage of the reform process.
