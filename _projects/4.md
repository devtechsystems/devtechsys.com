DevTech evaluated the curriculum and course content of a master's degree program in business economics to be offered in September 1986 to Latin America and the Caribbeann students. DevTech performed a two-pronged demand analysis of the program to determine the level of interest in neighboring countries and their students, as well as the potential demand for graduates of the program.
