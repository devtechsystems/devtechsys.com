Start Year: '2008'
End Year: '2008'
ISO3 Code:
  - ZMB
Region: Africa
Country: Zambia
Client/ Donor: USAID/Zambia
Brief Description: >-
  DevTech led an impact evaluation to access the impact of USAID/Zambia's Fast
  Track Initiative (FTI) funding on the development of community schools. The
  evaluation reviewed the activities and achievements of USAID's one-time FTI
  funding, which was made available to accelerate the achievement of universal
  primary education through three existing programs. The study assessed the
  degree to which USAID supplementary support strengthened the ability of the
  Ministry of Education to support community schools at the various
  institutional levels (national, provincial/district, community, school, and
  classroom) of the education delivery system. The evaluation also examined
  specific teacher training interventions at the target community schools. Based
  on the findings of the evaluation, DevTech identified potential directions for
  future education programming in Zambia, strategic targets for FTI funding, and
  proposed options to address the challenge of teacher attrition in the country.
