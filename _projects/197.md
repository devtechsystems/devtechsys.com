DevTech provided expertise to the government of Kyrgyzstan in its effort to decentralize its fiscal system. DevTech analyzed the national and provincial budgets, subsidies, taxes and social funds. DevTech also studied the effectiveness of the existing subsidized programs and evaluated the intra-regional transfers, as well as the transparency of the subsidies and the techniques used to select public investments. DevTech compiled the information, designed a survey, and organized the implementation of the survey and analysis of the data. DevTech issued recommendations to the government of Kyrgyzstan on the priorities that should be considered in reducing poverty.
