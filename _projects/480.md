The Colombia Monitoring and Evaluation Program (MEP) supported USAID/Colombia’s management information needs to facilitate informed program management decisions, and shape the mission’s long-term strategic direction. The program’s primary objective was to develop an M&E mechanism that provided continued performance monitoring, verification, and impact evaluation of program results, including environmental compliance.
