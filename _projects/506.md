A team of two international gender specialists from the task order and the GenDev Office Director conducted two training workshops in Honduras. A one and half day training was conducted for USAID staff (primarily CORs), which included an introduction to the new USAID Gender Policy. Thereafter, a training workshop for partners with similar materials was held. Several USAID CORs participated with their teams in the preparation of a poster exhibit on how to integrate gender into project activities.
