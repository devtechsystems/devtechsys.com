To prepare for its CDCS, West Bank Gaza developed a two-phase assignment with three components. The first phase included a gender review of the existing assistance objectives and then a sector-based gender analysis for economic growth, infrastructure, education, health, and governance. A team of one international expert and three Palestinians completed this phase of the assignment. The second phase was a gender training activity held for USAID and partners, which was conducted by one international expert and a USAID staff member, with support from one of the Palestinians on the gender assessment team.
