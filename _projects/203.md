DevTech led an assessment of how the Initiative for Social Action and Renewal (ISAR) programs fit and contributed to the USAID Central Asia Republicsâ€™ assistance strategy, especially regarding \"increased, better-informed citizen's participation in political and economic decision making\" and \"reduced environmental risks to public health.\"Regional specialists in civil society organizations and environmental problems in the region conducted field interviews in six cities in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan on ongoing and completed activities. DevTech issued recommendations on activities that should be discontinued, replicated, or expanded to ensure the sustainability of and support for environmental nongovernmental organizations in the region and their activities to promote environmental protection.
