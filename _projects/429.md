In support of the GenDev Office, the task order managed the delivery of a gender integration workshop hosted by USAID/Egypt for gender focal points, program officers, other relevant staff, and implementing partners of the Middle East Missions, aimed at increasing knowledge of gender integration in USAID programming. This was the first of a series of trainings/workshops. The materials for the training were posted to the web for the participants.
