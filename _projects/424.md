DevTech designed and pilot tested a GPS-based customs transit control system in close collaboration with Guatemala's revenue authority, the Superintendencia de Administracion Tributaria (SAT). The system was designed to operate with the SAT's current IT infrastructure, and provided SAT officials the ability to monitor containers crossing the country's borders. In addition to the design of the system, DevTech designed on-line training modules that could be used by SAT officials throughout the country to train them in the use of the system. The project was recognized by both the SAT and USTDA as a successful effort to improve Guatemala's customs administration.
