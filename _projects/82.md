  The goal of the Environmental Audit program was to provide a continuing
  program of internal, independent oversight of DOE line management's
  environmental performance, in support of DOE's broader goal of achieving full
  compliance with applicable regulations, reduction of environmental risk, and
  environmental excellence.A DevTech team provided administrative and
  information management support services to the Office of Environmental Audit
  at DOE facilities nationwide. The team was responsible for the implementation,
  operation, documentation, and maintenance of systems for the collection,
  verification, and publication of audit team (i.e., DOE staff and contractors)
  data.For each audit, DevTech's administrative team wrote and produced 50-page
  site handbooks for use by audit team members in preparing for the on-site
  portion of the audit and writing the report; produced an on-site, 200-page
  draft report, including compilation of sections by technical specialists,
  integration of graphics, editing, and coordination of printing; and produced
  camera-ready final reports incorporating site, technical specialist, and
  editorial comments for printing by the Government Printing Office.
