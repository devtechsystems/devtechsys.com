  with USAID, PVO, and project management unit officials; interviewed a sample
  of target beneficiaries; reviewed technical assistance interventions; assessed
  the effects of project implementation; examined priorities and needs of
  participating PVOs; and recommended ways in which project goals could be
  realized.
