CTIS, through the Global Technology Network (GTN), facilitates the transfer of U.S. technology to USAID assisted countries and regions. As USAID missions and local public and private sector partners identify development problems, GTN, through its extensive databases, is able to match the developing country's needs with specific U.S. companies having the appropriate technologies, expertise, and products to address these problems.GTN focuses on identifying international business opportunities in environment and energy, agribusiness, health and population, and communication and information technologies.
