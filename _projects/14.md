DevTech conducted a macro- and microeconomic study of the legal system of Panama, with special emphasis on the administration of justice. This pioneering research, performed under USAID/Washington sponsorship, involved analysis of the costs and financing of the justice sector, an assessment of the internal efficiency of the system, and studies of the markets for legal services, labor markets of lawyers, and the impact of the legal system on the economy.
