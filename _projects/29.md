Under a World Bank Technical Assistance Loan, DevTech conducted a technical assistance project to strengthen the investment planning and project appraisal capabilities of the Costa Rican public sector. The project included a critical review of current investment planning practices and formulation of an improvement strategy, a series of lectures and workshops to train government personnel in project preparation and cost-benefit analysis, and the development of computer applications for investment planning.
