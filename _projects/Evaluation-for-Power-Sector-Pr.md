Brief Description: 'The purpose of the PSP evaluation was to help the Bureau of Energy
  Resources determine the effectiveness of PSP activities and to identify lessons
  learned for PSP management decisions going forward. DevTech Systems was tasked with
  addressing: the effectiveness of ENR coordination with PSP stakeholders; the usefulness
  of PSP activities to benefitting governments and lessons learned for recommending
  changes to future PSP programming. The evaluation focused on the time period from
  early 2013, when ENR launched the PSP, to the end of calendar year 2015, roughly
  the third year of implementation. Based on the statement of work, the DevTech Evaluation
  Team developed a PSP Evaluation Management Plan. The evaluation was conducted over
  a four-month period from November 2015 to March 2016 by a four-member team of evaluation
  specialists and energy experts. Activities evaluated largely focused on promoting
  increased integration of power sectors across different countries, as well as fostering
  the generation of electricity from alternative (renewable) energy sources.'
