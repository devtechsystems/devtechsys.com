  In partnership with the M Group, DevTech conducted a feasibility study for the
  BIR's Outsourcing Initiative. As part of this feasibility study, DevTech
  conducted a thorough analysis of the information technology assets to be
  included in the outsourcing arrangement. Typically these assets comprise a
  mixture of hardware, software, services, processes, and personnel.DevTech also
  analyzed organizational issues related to the general approach and framework,
  specific methodologies and procedures, and their rationale.Legal and
  regulatory issues were also considered, including a \"Benefits Funding\"
  scheme, current legislation and statutes, and any legal issues that may affect
  the outsourcing and/or BOT (\"Build-Own-Transfer\") arrangement.In addition,
  DevTech assisted the BIR in preparing the business case to be presented to the
  Legislature, including the scope and structure of the outsourcing arrangement
  that is most appropriate to BIR's circumstances; ways of overcoming
  legal/regulatory obstacles that have been identified; and the controls that
  will be put in place to ensure, among other things, the quality and security
  of the outsourcing arrangement and the equitable treatment to be accorded BIR
  employees under the arrangement. DevTech also assisted in preparing the tender
  documents and provided guidance to the BIR in the bid solicitation and
  evaluation stages.
