The Gender Assessment and Analysis for USAID/Paraguay was prepared in anticipation of a new Strategic Plan to guide Mission programs after 2005. The assessment includes a discussion of gender concerns in the on-going and future activities. Recommendations are offered for increased gender mainstreaming in the Strategic Objective areas and the development of a Gender Action Plan for the Mission.
