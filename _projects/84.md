DevTech operated a multi-year Evaluation of USAID Rural Roads based out of DevTech's Conakry office. DevTech supported USAID in evaluating techncial assistance to the Guinean National Directorate for Rural Engineering (DNGR) in developing a permanent Monitoring and Evaluation system to measure the impact of rural road improvements. This system was put in place, and effectively allowed the impacts of rural road development to be measured. DevTech supported impact surveys, which were carried out on a semi-annual basis and covered 56 pre-selected sites, including long-term studies measuring the impact on two dozen sites along rural roads, and building out counterfactuals based on roughly two dozen villages along unimproved roads that were used as control sites. DevTech measured impact across an array of indicators, including health, education, economic growth, security, trade, SME development, commercial transactions, and environment.
