description: >-
  DevTech operated a multi-year Evaluation of USAID Rural Roads based out of
  DevTech's Conakry office. DevTech supported USAID in evaluating techncial
  assistance to the Guinean National Directorate for Rural Engineering (DNGR) in
  developing a permanent Monitoring and Evaluation system to measure the impact
  of rural road improvements. This system was put in place, and effectively
  allowed the impacts of rural road development to be measured. DevTech
  supported impact surveys, which were carried out on a semi-annual basis and
  covered 56 pre-selected sites, including long-term studies measuring the
  impact on two dozen sites along rural roads, and building out counterfactuals
  based on roughly two dozen villages along unimproved roads that were used as
  control sites. DevTech measured impact across an array of indicators,
  including health, education, economic growth, security, trade, SME
  development, commercial transactions, and environment.
