Brief Discription: >-
  DevTech prepared a concept paper that critically reviewed the educational
  climate in six countries in the Latin America/Caribbean region (Costa Rica,
  the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama). The
  paper's central thesis was that a crisis existed in the educational systems of
  the countries of the region that adversely affected the human resource
  endowment of the societies. This phenomenon, comparable in terms of economic
  consequences to the destruction of the rain forest, had far-reaching
  implications for the economic and social development prospects of the region.
  In its discussion of the educational crisis, the paper addressed financial
  constraints, the dilemma of quality versus coverage, and dependence on
  external financial resources. Reform was suggested on the following fronts:
  priority of educational policy, institutional reform of education ministries,
  improved teacher salaries, decentralized administrative functions, and
  increased effectiveness and sustainability of international assistance.
