Brief Description: 'In an effort to foster fiscal decentralization in the Government
  of Mexico, DevTech, under contract to ICMA, provided strategic support to the Fiscal
  Coordination Commission. DevTech sought to enable the Commission to become the key
  forum for dialogue on fiscal decentralization and to develop concrete proposals
  for changes and/or improvements to existing laws and policies that the Commission
  can take to the Mexican National Congress for approval. These efforts helped the
  Commission better articulate the demand for fiscal decentralization in the country
  and develop specific initiatives to reform/improve upon existing laws, regulations,
  and practices.As part of this effort, DevTech:>Assessed the state of intergovernmental
  relations, including distribution of revenues, spending, etc., and the legal framework
  for the federal and state constitutions and local government law;>Trained members
  of the Commission in transfer systems, assignment of roles and responsibilities,
  service delivery models and best practices based on international experience;>Designed
  and supervised a variety of technical studies; and>Organized a seminar to review
  these studies and to arrive at a consensus on the future of fiscal federalism.DevTech
  helped the Instituto para el Desarrollo Técnico de las Haciendas Públicas (INDETEC)
  publish these studies in a single volume book titled: Enfoques Alternativos del
  Federalismo Fiscal en México (Alternative Foci for Fiscal Federalism in Mexico).This
  final work represented a broad consensus for reform, endorsed by the major players,
  but based on solid technical analysis. The broad distribution and discussion of
  this book helped ensure that these issues would start to rise to the top of the
  political and legislative agenda.'
