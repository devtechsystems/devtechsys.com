DevTech carried out an evaluation of the cost and financing of basic education in El Salvador and its implications for long-term educational development strategies and policies. Special attention was given to the resource-allocation and decision-making systems and their effectiveness in educational management; the relationship between teachers' salaries and the quality of basic education; and the alternatives to improve the management of education via decentralization.
