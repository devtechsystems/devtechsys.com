USAID El Salvador asked for a review of the Commercial Code of El Salvador with the idea ofdetermining its impact on the costs and time required to establish a new business in the country.It was thought that the process was cumbersome, that it added unnecessary costs for newinvestment and that it served to inhibit new investment and thus economic development.
