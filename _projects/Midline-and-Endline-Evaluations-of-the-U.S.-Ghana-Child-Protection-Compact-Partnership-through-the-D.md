  DevTech completed the midline performance evaluation of the U.S.-Ghana Child

  the TIP Office to conduct the endline evaluation. The midline evaluation,
  which evaluated the first two years of the compact partnership (10/1/15 -
  9/30/17) by replicating elements of the baseline methodology, collected and
  analyzed data from the national, regional and district level in five regions –
  three CPC-focused regions: Volta, Central, and Greater Accra; and two
  counterfactual regions: Eastern and Ashanti – in order to determine the extent
  to which the CPC Partnership was achieving its objectives (prevention,
  protection, prosecution, and process improvement), and to identify key
  obstacles, so that mid-course corrections could be made.
