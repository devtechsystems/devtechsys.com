The gender audit process addressed gender in programming issues and the practices and policies of the Mission as a whole (such as human resource issues, budgeting, and management), to provide a holistic picture of gender relations in several aspects of the organization. The report and its recommendations are based on meetings with Mission staff members and interviews with USAID implementing partners and the Ministry of Community Development, Gender, and Children in Dar es Salaam, as well as on the results of the survey and the focus group discussions.
