A team of three consultants provided an overview of factors affecting the status of women in Panama, key gender issues, and government, civil society, and donor resources directed to these issues. The report also focuses on the USAID/Panama strategic program areas to identify gender issues specific to these programs and the implementing partners, and makes recommendations for gender mainstreaming in the country plan.
