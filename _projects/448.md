The gender assessment requested by the regional office, USAID/CAR, was carried out by two US task order consultants, each covering several of the 5 countries, in tandem with local consultants from each country. The report focused on regional programs in economic growth, health and education, democracy and conflict mitigation, and programs for domestic violence and trafficking in persons that cut across all sectors. Recommendations were provided for the regional programs as well as by country.
