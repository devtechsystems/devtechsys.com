The Office of Global Women’s Issues (S/GWI) works to increase women’s and girls’ access to education and healthcare, to combat violence against girls in all its forms, and to ensure that women’s rights are fully integrated in the development of U.S. foreign policy. To ensure that these goals are being met, S/GWI contracted DevTech Systems, Inc. to conduct performance evaluations of two programs: the What to Expect Foundations’ Women’s Health Innovation Program (in Bangladesh and Liberia) and the Secretary’s Innovation Award program – which includes three different programs located in Kenya, Tanzania, and India. DevTech is also assisting S/GWI to conduct retrospective evaluations of various grantees.
