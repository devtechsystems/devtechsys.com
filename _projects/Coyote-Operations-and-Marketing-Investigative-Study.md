Project Title: Coyote Operations & Marketing Investigative Study
Start Year: '2018'
End Year: '2019'
ISO3 Code:
- GTM
Region: Latin America and the Caribbean
Country: Guatemala
Client/ Donor: U.S. Embassy
Brief Description: 'In September 2018, the United States Embassy in Guatemala engaged
  DevTech Systems, Inc. to conduct a study of Guatemala’s illegal coyote industry
  in the context of migration to the United States of America. While there is a  general
  understanding of the illegal migration phenomenon, there currently is only limited
  reliable information on the structure, operations, and marketing activities of those
  who conduct illegal migration assistance (human smuggling) activities. Findings
  focus on two research areas: coyote business structure and operations, and coyote
  marketing techniques. The evaluation team collected data through household and immigrant
  returnee surveys, media monitoring, “mystery client” research, in-depth interviews,
  expert interviews, and secondary literature research. The study has two objectives:  Research
  Area 1: “Coyote Structure and Operations” – Review the literature and conduct surveys
  to develop profiles of individuals who provide illegal human smuggling services
  to Guatemalans wishing to travel to the U.S. without appropriate documentation.
  Specifically, the study contributes to answering the questions: (a) Who are the
  coyotes? (b) Where do they operate? (c) How do they operate? Research Area 2: “Coyote
  Marketing” – Identify the marketing techniques used by coyotes who aid illegal migration
  from Guatemala to the U.S.  Data was collected in is six western highland municipalities
  in the three departments of San Marcos, Huehuetenango, and Quiché. These departments
  and municipalities were selected based on the high levels of poverty and the comparatively
  high percentage—relative to other Guatemalan locations—of populations who have recently
  attempted to cross, or succeeded in crossing, illegally into the United States.'
