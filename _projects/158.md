DevTech was contracted to evaluate the progress of modernization of the state programs being carried out with Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) funds. The IDB program supports reform efforts within the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government, as well as systems to strengthen civil society. DevTech staff reviewed projects in progress in Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, and Panama and documented their progress. Their executive report, which integrated parallel evaluations of a number of selected judicial and legislative reform projects, was presented to the IDB management with its 1998 Annual Portfolio Management Report.
