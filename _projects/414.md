DevTech and its associates signed a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Labor to lead the Combating Exploitative Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic project. In association with two Dominican organizations and a number of local subcontractors, DevTech built upon the successes of the last project and introduced new innovations to offer Dominican youth an alternative to exploitative child labor.
