The USAID Zambia training comprised three activities, a 3-day workshop for USAID/Zambia staff, a one-day workshop for partners, and a half-day briefing and discussion on gender with Senior Management. The training was delivered by a team of three gender specialists, including a GenDev staff member, a task order field international gender expert and a Zambian gender specialist.The training team also tailored the core material to fit the Zambian context, including recognizing that USAID/Zambia had completed its CDCS and was already into design phase. Particular attention was paid to preparing, within the limits of time and data availability, project-related case studies and discussion materials that drew from USAID's own work program in Zambia.
