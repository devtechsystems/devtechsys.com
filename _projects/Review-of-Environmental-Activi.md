Staff from DevTech Systems. Inc., the ENR institutional contractor, were requested to extract information from several sources and synthesize it in a format developed within the ENR Division. The information sources used in developing these discussions were:
* The Fiscal Year (FY) 2001 Congressional Budget Justification;
* The FY 2002 Congressional Budget Justification;
* The FY 2002 Results Review (R2a) (and in some case the FY 2001 R2a);
* The most recent Mission Strategic Plan; and
* The RIP and Ukraine Mission web sites 

These documents were reviewed for information about environmental projects and for projects that had potential environmental linkages. The information about each country was synthesized in the reports making up the remainder of this document. The individual country discussions were then forwarded to the Mission Program Officers who reviewed them for accuracy and resubmitted them to ENR staff where they were transmitted to DevTech for inclusion in the final report.
