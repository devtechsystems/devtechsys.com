DevTech worked through its mentor/protégé relationship with Duca Consulting to provide specific advisory and assistance services to USAID/Angola in its efforts to support the Angolan National Bank's (BNA) development of an Angolan professional accountant certification program. The goal was to assist USAID in defining the activities and expected results that lead to the broad adoption of internationally acceptable accounting standards in Angola. This included establishing both an institutional framework for overseeing the application of certification standards and the human and organizational capacity development aspects that are necessary to ensure the adoption and implementation of these standards.
