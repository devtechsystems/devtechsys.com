The Budget Process Support (BPS) Project assisted the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (GFRN) in establishing a transparent and macroeconomically sound national budget process that integrated macroeconomic forecasts with strategic policy goals. The BPS Project's goal was to help the GFRN solidify institutional roles in the budget preparation process and establish a multi-year budgeting capability. The project provided technical assistance and training in the areas of planning processes, budget preparation and formulation, budget execution, and organizational development. DevTech provided technical assistance in organizational development to the Budget Office of the Federation (BOF) in the Ministry of Finance and to the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence (BMPI) Unit of the Office of the President.The BOF was divided into several departments that had historically functioned as separate entities, with little understanding or incentive for aligning each department under a unifying overall objective, resulting in inefficiency, mismanagement, and unclear roles. Thus, DevTech conducted a participatory analysis of the departments, and then helped them to clearly define their respective roles in the budget process regarding the overall BOF strategic plan. Following this exercise, DevTech helped BOF staff develop departmental objectives that were in alignment with the overall BOF objectives, with measurable performance indicators built into each objective. DevTech staff also provided input into the development of a training program.The BMPI unit was responsible for ensuring that the Office of the President was fully informed about the budgetary process at three levels:Budget Formulation—providing a pool of experts and a Price Intelligence Database (PID) tool to ensure accuracy and authenticity of expenditure proposals submitted by various governmental units;Budget Prioritization—establishing the strategic and planning priorities for future allocation of resources; andBudget Execution—enhancing the efficiency and the effectiveness of programs and service delivery as well as the overall management of resources.The BMPI Unit's staff members were mostly contract hires and the BMPI Unit Director planned to have these positions and these staff \"regularized\" into the civil service, as full-time staff.To help the BMPI Unit achieve its goals, DevTech assessed consultants' contracts and assisted with planning for the transition of consultancies to full-time staff. DevTech staff reviewed the consultants' perceptions regarding their work with the BMPI vis-à-vis their career development targets; identified factors that inhibit and stimulate the staff in their current roles, and incentives that would make employment more attractive; and provided a methodology to regularize the consulting staff of the BMPI within the civil service structure, upon full-time enrollment. DevTech also conducted an evaluation of existing skills of personnel and identified additional skills required of sector specialists and training needs; helped BMPI staff define personnel job descriptions and create a nomenclature of compensation; identified ways to attract additional expertise into the BMPI Unit; identified a transition strategy for departing staff (sector specialists) and new hires; defined recruitment procedures for new hires; and reviewed and developed organizational performance, standards of performance, appraisal, and teamwork.
