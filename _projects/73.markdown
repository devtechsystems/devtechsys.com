Brief Description: "As a follow-up to the Immediate Recovery Project in Panama (USAID 1990-1991), DevTech provided long-term support to the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy (MIPPE). This assistance was divided into two components.\r\n\r\nThe first component involved provision of a long-term, resident senior macroeconomic advisor to MIPPE for policy reform and implementation.
