From August 2012 – October 2012, DevTech led an evaluation of six projects for USAID/Guatemala, including four final evaluations and two mid-term evaluations.The end-of-project performance evaluations for four rural value chain projects were:the Access to Dynamic Markets for Rural Small and Medium Enterprises project implemented by the Guatemalan Association of Exporters (AGEXPORT),the Competitive Enterprises in Coffee project with the National Coffee Association (ANACAFE),the Forestry Enterprises in Guatemala project with Rainforest Alliance,Guatemala Community Tourism Alliance with Counterpart International.The mid-term performance evaluations of two ongoing projects were:the Inclusive Market Alliance for Rural Entrepreneurs (IMARE) project, a public-private partnership between USAID and Mercy Corps/Wal-Mart for horticultural value chains;TIERRAS Land Conflict Resolution project implemented by Mercy Corps in the departments of Alta Verapaz and Quiche.This evaluation analyzed the effectiveness of USAID/Guatemala Economic Growth Office agricultural and environmental value chain projects at the strategic and individual project levels to validate or improve USAID’s approach and to learn from results. The project evaluations looked at the high-level results as they related to each project’s objectives, and looked to inform new project implementation under the new five-year Country Development and Cooperation Strategy (CDCS), as well as heavily influence upcoming FtF and GCC strategy implementation.For the each project evaluation, DevTech and its partner, AMEX International, utilized the methods of document review, interviews, field visits, and a review of quantitative data. For the mid-term projects, this evaluation was able to demonstrate to USAID/Guatemala what is not working and why, provided recommendations to the Mission as to what should be adjusted or eliminated, and also made suggestions as to how to increase the sustainability for this project. For the end-of-project evaluations, the Team was able to provide USAID/Guatemala with information regarding the projects meeting their objectives, as well as recommendations on how future projects could meet the Mission’s Feed the Future Multi-year Strategy. This evaluation also looked at the level of gender integration for each project.
