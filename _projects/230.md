Brief Discription: >-
  As a SEGIR-EP subcontractor, DevTech assisted the three tax administrations in
  Bosnia and Herzegovina (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of
  Srpska, and the District of Brcko) to develop a comprehensive design for tax
  administration reform under strict and challenging time constraints.The TAMP
  team applied Business Process Analysis and Business Process Reengineering
  techniques using a sophisticated software program to fully document the tax
  administration processes and propose reengineered processes and their
  automation. DevTech technical experts developed complete automation plans,
  full systemization design and architecture, database development, and data
  processing centralization. In addition, DevTech completed an assessment of the
  legal framework for tax administration and tax policy, and established a
  system to ensure that future necessary legal reforms will be defined in a way
  that will help to facilitate further reform.All tasks were completed on time
  and within scope. In addition to the original scope of work, USAID asked TAMP
  to support the immediate implementation of the Taxpayer Registration system.
