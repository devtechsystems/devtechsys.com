This Gender Assessment (GA) analyzes the impact of programs and projects on gender relations, andmakes recommendations for incorporating gender issues/concerns in the future. USAID/Bangladesh’s (USAID/B) portfolio is examined to offer suggestions for mainstreaming gender, and to make actionable recommendations that can be implemented in the short (one to six months), medium (one to two years), and long-term (for the five-year strategy). This study also updates the Mission’s gender action plan (GAP), and provides background for a new Mission strategy for 2011-2015.
