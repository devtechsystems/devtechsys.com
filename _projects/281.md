The Safe Schools Program was a five-year program to create gender-safe environments for girls and boys and promote gender-equitable relationships within schools in Malawi and Ghana. This pioneering, evidence-based initiative was designed to reduce school-related gender-based violence (SRGBV), improve educational outcomes, and reduce negative health outcomes. Program interventions were implemented in schools in the two countries and focused on students ranging in age from approximately 10 to 14.DevTech was the prime contractor for this pilot project for USAID. In both countries, DevTech fully collaborated with civil society and community organizations to develop local capacity to design, implement, and monitor and evaluate SRGBV prevention interventions and their impact so that gender safety could become the norm in schools. The program also worked with stakeholders on the national and institutional level to provide training and raise awareness of SRGBV so that these actors could assist those on the community and individual levels. The final product of the Safe Schools program was a series of three global Doorways training manuals (students, community counselors, and teachers) and country-specific materials still in use. These materials were also translated into several different languages and are used in other countries across the globe.The Safe Schools project demonstrates the benefit of using evidence-based, collaborative approaches, as well as DevTech's dedication to true capacity-building. DevTech is proud that other organizations are using these materials developed with American taxpayer money to reduce gender-based violence in schools.Save the Children, Plan International, and the Malawian YouthNet and Counselling (YONECO) are among several international organizations that have adopted and implemented the Safe Schools training materials to continue to address school violence in Malawi, and in programs in other countries, including Haiti and Senegal. In addition, USAID has translated the Safe Schools training materials into Arabic, Russian, French, and Spanish, and has posted them on its website.The manuals and other interventions have been used throughout the program at each of the following levels:Individual levelThe Doorways Student Training Manual utilizes a children's rights approach and gender approach to teaching children about appropriate gender relations. Based on the results of the program endline survey, the piloting of the manual was successful at increasing students' knowledge of, and changing their attitudes regarding, SRGBV. The classroom program was complemented with additional interventions such as theater for development, radio, gender clubs, after-school programs, and assemblies. An excellent example of the children applying what they learned can be viewed on a video entitled: Mister Speaker, Sir.Community levelThe Doorways Community Counselors Training Manual provides resources at the community level to identify and refer cases of school-related gender-based violence to service providers.Institutional levelThe Doorways Teachers Training Manual provides training for education professionals on SRGBV awareness, prevention, reporting, and referral. The program endline survey confirmed that after receiving the training, teachers had changed their attitudes about their role in preventing SRGBV and how to apply the Teachers' Code of Conduct. In addition, improved and consolidated Codes of Conduct were developed in both pilot countries by the respective teachers' unions and education ministries.National levelAn Advocates Network was formed to raise awareness of SRGBV among key stakeholders and government officials. Also, a series of campaign posters was developed in each country.PublicationsThe Safe Schools Program: Ghana Assessment ReportThe Safe Schools Program: Ethiopia Assessment ReportThe Safe Schools Program: Jamaica Assessment ReportThe Safe Schools Program: Malawi Assessment ReportThe Safe Schools Program: Quantitative Research Instrument to Measure School-Related Gender-Based ViolenceThe Safe Schools Program: Student and Teacher Baseline Report on School-Related Gender-Based Violence in Machinga District, MalawiThe Safe Schools Program: A Qualitative Study to Examine School-Related Gender-Based Violence in MalawiSafe Schools Program: Final Report
