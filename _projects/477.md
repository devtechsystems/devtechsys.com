The task order provided a team leader for an evaluation of the USG GBV programs in Zambia. The evaluation team included staff members from USAID/Washington and the Center for Disease Control (CDC)/Atlanta. The team utilized a victim-centered, culturally-responsive approach, using standard quantitative and qualitative evaluation methodology, including a desk review of 36 USAID and CDC monitoring and reporting documents; key informant interviews with 240 beneficiaries, stakeholders, and ministry officials; 24 site visits/observations, including all eight of the Coordinated Response Center sites, both CDC sites, and other centers at which services were provided (e.g., emergency shelters for women and children, hospitals, and Police Station Victim Service Units). Recent service statistics were collected from each service site to compare project-specific GBV program data with existing Zambia DHS 2007 (National) GBV prevalence data to identify and analyze current trends regarding GBV types and prevalence.
