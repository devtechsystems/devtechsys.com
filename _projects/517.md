  DevTech is currently implementing the four-year USAID-funded Community Action
  for Reading and Security (CARS) Activity in Nicaragua. The purpose of CARS is
  to improve early grade reading outcomes and contribute to reducing citizen
  insecurity in five municipalities of the Region Autonoma Atlantica Sur in
  Nicaragua, where both education and crime statistics lag behind the national
  averages. DevTech is working in close partnership with local organizations to
  implement an evidence-based approach to conduct activities at the municipal,
  community, and school level to transition to a local-led model to educational
  development and citizen security.
