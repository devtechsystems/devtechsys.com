Task order evaluation under the Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (J/TIP) BPA.

The midline performance evaluation of the project in Ghana will determine the extent to which the CPC Partnership model has improved the Ghanaian Government’s response to child trafficking in Ghana, considering the three fundamental anti-trafficking strategies – prosecuting traffickers, protecting victims, and preventing trafficking – as well as coordination. This midline evaluation builds on the two comprehensive, J/TIP -funded baseline assessments conducted on child trafficking in Ghana – the assessment of the state of child trafficking in Ghana, conducted by Westat, and the Nordic Consulting Group Denmark A/S and JMK Consulting of Ghana baseline report on FTS’ Growing Up Free program in Volta and Central regions in Ghana.
