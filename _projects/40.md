DevTech was contracted to provide technical and logistical support for the National Defense Executive Reserve Conference held in February 1991. The purpose of the program was to enhance the readiness of reservists who were civilian professionals involved in sectors such as agriculture, business and industry, education, energy, labor, management, and transportation. DevTech's responsibility was to assist FEMA in planning for and executing a successful conference. DevTech adapted the conference preparations and planning to absorb the involvement of conference participants in Operation Desert Storm.
