DevTech carried out a study to analyze the direct lending operations of the National Development Foundation/Jamaica. The project involved an assessment of the functions and operations of the Board of Directors, a study of the feasibility of using guarantee scheme programs for microenterprise lending in Jamaica, a management audit of the foundation, and an assessment of the long-term viability of the institution. It also required specific appraisals of counseling and training programs, lending operations, management information systems, and the overall impact of social and economic factors on the effectiveness of the institution's operations.
