The analysis included a wide range of sectoral activities of the ministry, including capital markets, financial enterprises, the insurance industry, fisheries, mineral resources, domestic and international trade, patent and brand registration, and the definition of industry standards.The project also analyzed general economic conditions that affect the development of the private sector, especially labor markets, market imperfections in the transportation industry, the legal system, and the body of laws regarding property rights and the security of contractual relations.
