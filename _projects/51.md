DevTech provided technical assistance to the government of Panama under its Immediate Recovery Project to initiate the restructuring of public institutions to promote the confidence, security, and continuity necessary for democratic processes and economic reactivation. DevTech's role was to assist the Panamanian government in developing and beginning implementation of the economic and financial policy reforms that would allow for a new, sustainable growth strategy. DevTech fielded two resident core advisors, in addition to a wide variety of short-term technical assistance experts, to provide strategic advice in such fields as privatization, social security, debt restructuring, housing, fuel production and consumption, investment and export strategies, health, and agriculture.
