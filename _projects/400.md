The WATERS Program focused primarily on providing accurate and timely information on USAID's water and coastal resources management activities and on the levels of financial support provided by the Agency, State Department, and other federal agencies. The program also provided technical support for writing, analysis, and reporting in support of the USAID Economic Growth, Agriculture, and Trade Bureau's Office of Natural Resources.
