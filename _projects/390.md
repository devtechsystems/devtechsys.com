The assessment was requested to prepare for the development of the 2007-2009 country strategy. Through a review of research and program documents, and interviews with USAID staff and partners as well as key individuals representing non-governmental and other donor organizations, the assessment identified gender relations and gender-based constraints that may affect or be affected by USAID programs. It includes general factors to be addressed in the Strategy Statement, as well as more specific factors to be considered in the preparation of activity-specific documents (such as sector analyses, operational plans and activity designs).
