A two day workshop on how to mainstream gender into gender-based violence prevention programs provided additional TA support to the Health Policy Initiative (HPI) Project in Peru, for MINSA, the General Office of Health Statistics, the Ministry of Women and Social Development (MIMDES), and the National Institute of Mental Health. In the workshop, case studies were presented and participants received CD-ROMs containing technical guides for research, programming, and monitoring and evaluation to address GBV. The team also organized a round table with representatives of the Ministries of Health, Interior, Justice, and of Women and Social Development for presentations on advancements and ongoing challenges in addressing GBV in their sectors.
