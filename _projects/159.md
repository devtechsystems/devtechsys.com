For the Ministry of Education of Guatemala, DevTech developed a negotiated proposal for restructuring the Ministry to ensure that bilingual/inter-cultural education is an integral part of the national education program, as mandated by the Peace Accords. The proposal was well-received by officials at all levels of the Ministry and will be implemented over the next several years.
