description: >-
  This was the final installment of a series of regional trainings. The
  materials developed in this workshop highlighted the importance of integrating
  gender into the program cycle. The training workshop was funded by the GenDev
  office but each Mission sending a representative had to fund the training
  facility-costs. Despite this cost the subscription to the workshop was greater
  than the ideal number for this type of training.
