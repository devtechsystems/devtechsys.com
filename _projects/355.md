This was the final installment of a series of regional trainings. The materials developed in this workshop highlighted the importance of integrating gender into the program cycle. The training workshop was funded by the GenDev office but each Mission sending a representative had to fund the training facility-costs. Despite this cost the subscription to the workshop was greater than the ideal number for this type of training.
