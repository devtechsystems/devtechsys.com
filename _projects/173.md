DevTech prepared a paper on decentralization and local development in Latin America and the Caribbean focusing on past successes and outlining a future strategy for incorporating municipalities in the post-Hurricane Mitch reconstruction and transformation. The paper was presented at the USAID Donor Consultative Group Meeting on Latin America and the Caribbean in Stockholm, Sweden in May 1999.
