As part of the process to update the Biodiversity Assessment for Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission in Kiev was required to prepare the FAA 119 Biodiversity Analysis report to comply with Section 119 of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA). DevTech conducted a multi-country biodiversity analysis, and prepared a report for each country and a synthesis of issues facing the region.
