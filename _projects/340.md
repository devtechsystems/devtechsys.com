USAID/Russia identified a need for practical training on how to implement operational recommendations made in the Russian Gender Assessment Report from 2004. The team helped the Mission integrate gender analysis into the new strategy and activity designs, improve gender statements in awards, develop gender sensitive results frameworks and PMP, and learn how to monitor reporting for compliance with requirements to collect and analyze sex-disaggregated data. In addition, the team provided USAID/Russia training on how to collect and use the data (once it was collected). The team also provided recommendations on the inclusion of gender considerations for a number of concept papers being developed by USAID.
