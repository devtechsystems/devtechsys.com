description: >-
  USAID/Russia identified a need for practical training on how to implement
  operational recommendations made in the Russian Gender Assessment Report from
  2004. The team helped the Mission integrate gender analysis into the new
  strategy and activity designs, improve gender statements in awards, develop
  gender sensitive results frameworks and PMP, and learn how to monitor
  reporting for compliance with requirements to collect and analyze
  sex-disaggregated data. In addition, the team provided USAID/Russia training
  on how to collect and use the data (once it was collected). The team also
  provided recommendations on the inclusion of gender considerations for a
  number of concept papers being developed by USAID.
