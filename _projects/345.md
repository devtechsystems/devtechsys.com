The purpose of the assessment was to aid USAID/Serbia & Montenegro (SAM) to identify key gender issues and constraints that need to be addressed in developing the new strategic plan for FY 2005-2009. The assessment outlined the gender equity goals for the Mission, and identified gender training needs. The team also helped to draft a Gender Action Plan (GAP). The assessment included a document review, and in person interviews in Belgrade, Podgorica Cetinj and Kotor, Montenegro and Kragujevac, Serbia. The team leader also conducted a training session for USAID staff in Belgrade.
