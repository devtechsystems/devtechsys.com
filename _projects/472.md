The four-day regional training held in Bangkok included participants from USAID Missions/Offices in RDMA, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Cambodia. Regional topics such as water and food security were included, as well as a discussion of TIP. The main feedback from the evaluations was the need to bring concrete examples. For participants not involved in a particular sector (such as food security or TIP) the content was less useful.
