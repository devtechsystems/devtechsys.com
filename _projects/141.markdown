Brief Description: >-
  RUTA Social is a technical assistance program for the design and execution of
  social sector projects in the Latin America and the Caribbeann countries. The
  project was started in the second half of 1993 to assist the governments of
  the region in finding effective ways to address chronic social sector
  problems. Participants included the governments of Belize, Costa Rica, El
  Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. The general objective of
  the DevTech-led evaluation mission was to assess the relevance of RUTA Social
  as a strategy for assisting these governments to achieve a higher efficiency
  in the funding and delivery of social services as well as in targeting
  resources for poverty alleviation. The evaluation mission produced a report
  (in Spanish) highlighting the successes and shortcomings of RUTA Social and
  offering recommendations for restructuring the program to better fulfill its
  stated objectives.
