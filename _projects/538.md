The project evaluated is the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) CambodiaProgram on Rights and Justice II (PRAJ II), currently being implemented by the East-West Management Institute (EWMI). The program began its first course in 2003 (as PRAJ I). Beginning in 2008, PRAJ II (a US $20 million program) has focused on civil society strengthening. Originally scheduled to close in September 2013, PRAJ II has been extended one year (with an additional two million dollars of funding).The dual purpose of the evaluation was to: 1) Provide critical information to USAID/Cambodia toinform the design and strategy of its next generation of Democracy and Governance (DG)programming; and 2) Develop the capacity of USAID staff in the field of evaluation by including them as members of the evaluation team. The approach to this internal evaluation emerged out of aUSAID/Washington, Policy, Planning, and Learning Bureau/ Learning, Evaluation and Research Office(PPL/LER) initiative to build USAID staff capacity to better commission, manage and use evaluations by conducting one as part of an evaluation team.
