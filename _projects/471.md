The three-day workshop was held in Panama (off-site) for 23 participants from USAID/Panama, USAID/Honduras, USAID/El Salvador, Peace Corps Panama, the International Organization of Migration, Government of Panama, the State Department, and USAID implementing partners. Overall the training was well-received, particularly the participatory and experimental nature of the learning experience.
