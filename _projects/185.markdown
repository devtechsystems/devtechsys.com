  DevTech was contracted to evaluate the progress of modernization of the state
  programs being carried out with Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) funds.
  The IDB program supports reform efforts within the executive, judicial, and
  legislative branches of government, as well as systems to strengthen civil
  society. DevTech staff reviewed projects in progress in Peru, Argentina,
  Uruguay, and Panama and documented their progress. Their executive report,

  legislative reform projects, was presented to the IDB management with its 1998
  Annual Portfolio Management Report.
