DevTech conducted a summative evaluation of USAID/Guinea's education program with a six-member technical assessment team. The evaluation gauged the viability of USAID's approaches, and evaluated the efficiency, management, sustainability, impact, and results of USAID's education activities in Guinea since their inception. The evaluation team focused on the Fundamental Quality and Equity Levels project (FQEL), the Community Participation for Equity and Quality in Basic Education project (PACEEQ), as well as other major education program activities.
