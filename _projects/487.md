The purpose of the review is to monitor the extent to which USAID is taking account of gender considerations in solicitations for competitive grants and contracts, pursuant to strengthened Agency guidance. Progress in gender integration across sectors and geographic regions as well as between Missions and Washington operating units is also of interest.The methodology used for this report is the same as that used for the review of solicitations used in 2010, though the number of solicitations in 2011 is larger: 203 compared to 147. Documents were scored on a scale of zero to three, measuring gender content of “none,” “minimal,” “moderate,” or “thorough.” The 2010 review should not be treated as a baseline per se; among other things, the larger number of solicitations in 2011 allowed two additional sectoral categories to be designated. Some of the categories used for analysis contain a relatively small number of observations, thus, in drawing conclusions and making generalizations statistical results should be used with care.
