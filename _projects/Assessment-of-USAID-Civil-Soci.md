Start Year: '2001'
End Year: '2002'
ISO3 Code:
- DOM
Region: Latin America and the Caribbean
Country: Dominican Republic
Client/ Donor: USAID
Brief Description: DevTech led a team of evaluation and civil society specialists
  with extensive knowledge of the Dominican Republic to conduct a comprehensive assessment
  of the impact of USAID's Strengthening Civil Society Project, which included the
  Democratic Initiative Project (PID), providing substantial resources to Participación
  Ciudadana (PC), and supporting Rule of Law activities related to civil society through
  Fundación Institucionalidad y Justicia (FINJUS).The objectives of the assessment
  were to provide a rigorous review of the impact of USAID's investment in civil society;
  share input to help the Mission shape its next five-year strategy (2002—2007); and
  draw key lessons learned and best practices from USAID/DR's activities to promote
  the development of a politically active civil society in support of democracy.As
  part of this assessment, the team:Interviewed 187 key individuals in local and national
  government using semi-structured protocols;Conducted 22 focus groups throughout
  the country with PID sub-grantees and PC electoral observers;Conducted a nationwide
  survey of PID beneficiaries and PC electoral observers on values and practices of
  individuals and community groups related to democracy and civil society. The data
  from the nation-wide survey was then cross-analyzed to draw conclusions about the
  impact of program activities.The Assessment team concluded that there were several
  key factors critical to the success of implementing a program to strengthen civil
  society in the Dominican Republic. These were:Civil Society Programs require a long-term
  strategy. USAID/DR's foresight to support the initiative over a 10-year period was
  critical. It provided the necessary time to build the projects carefully, let them
  take hold, and eventually reach out to a broad and receptive public. Changing political
  culture needs at least a decade.One step behind approach is critical. An essential
  part of the strategy to promote democracy in the DR was to maintain a low profile,
  allowing the Dominican grantees to take the visible lead in pushing for democratic
  reforms. This one step behind strategy conferred legitimacy and credibility to the
  effort as a Dominican initiative and was key to its success.Flexibility. Given the
  fluidity of the political situation in the DR, it was essential for the USAID Mission
  to support a \"demand\" rather than a \"supply\" driven initiative. This approach
  helped to build momentum and contributed to the sustainability of the initiative
