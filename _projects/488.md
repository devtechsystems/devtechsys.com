USAID/Rwanda had completed its Global Health Initiative and Feed the Future Initiative strategies. Within this context, a gender assessment was conducted for the purposes of preparing the CDCS. A team consisting of the Mission Gender Focal Point, one international gender expert, and two Rwandan gender experts conducted the field work. Applying the new CDCS guidance, the gender assessment identified several key gender-based obstacles that were not addressed in either the GHI or FtF programs.
