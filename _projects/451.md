The gender assessment was requested to provide background and input for gender integration in programs activities in the three Mission program areas: DG, EG and investing in people (health and education). Youth programs, the bateys, and maternal/child health were important here. An expat and a Dominican completed the assessment, including recommendations and a draft plan of action. They also provided a half-day Mission-wide training on gender analysis and ADS requirements for gender.
