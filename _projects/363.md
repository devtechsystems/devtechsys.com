Of the several countries affected by the tsunami in December 2005, Sri Lanka suffered a great loss of life as a result of this devastating event. DevTech was a subcontractor on a post-tsunami reconstruction and development project led by CH2M Hill. DevTech assisted with short-term consultancies to support all aspects of the project, with a particular focus on vocational education. The project also focused on repair and reconstruction of harbors, bridges, and roads.
