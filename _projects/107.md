USAID's Private Voluntary Organizations Cofinancing Project in Nicaragua was designed to increase adoption of preventive health and family practices, expand employment opportunities for low-income families, and promote sustainable natural resource management among farmers. DevTech evaluators met with USAID, PVO, and project management unit officials; interviewed a sample of target beneficiaries; reviewed technical assistance interventions; assessed the effects of project implementation; examined priorities and needs of participating PVOs; and recommended ways in which project goals could be realized.
