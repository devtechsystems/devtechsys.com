As part of the process of preparing its first Mission Strategy, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) office in Cyprus was required to prepare the FAA 119 Biodiversity Analysis report to comply with Section 119 of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA).DevTech was the primary author of the final report, which provided a thorough environmental perspective of Cyprus. The report focused on biodiversity and environmental issues. The findings and recommendations were presented a manner consistent with USAID's Strategic Objective, \"conditions to foster a durable settlement in Cyprus are strengthened\" and were within the existing framework of the Mission's portfolio.The findings in the report were based on information gathered during interviews and site visits to the Greek Cypriot Community (GCC) in the south and the Turkish Cypriot Community (TCC) in the north. Places visited included the Salt Lake in Larnaca, the Paphos region and Akamas Peninsula in the south and the \"new road\" to the Karpaz Peninsula and Lefka in the north.
