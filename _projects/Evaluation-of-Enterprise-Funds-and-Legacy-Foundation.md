Brief Description: DevTech conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the Enterprise
  Funds and Legacy Foundations to provide USAID, other Fund and Foundation stakeholders,
  and the American public with an account of the experiences, successes and accomplishments,
  and shortcomings of the Funds and Foundations. The evaluation team used a combination
  of approaches and tools that varied by country. Primary sources included field visits
  in Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine and meetings with USG
  representatives, current and former Fund and Foundation staff, and site visits with
  samples of Enterprise Funds’ investees and Legacy Foundations’ grantees as a verification
  method from initial findings gathered from the document review, key informant interviews
  (KIIs), and focus group discussions (FGDs). The team used KIIs with stakeholders
  employing a semi-structured interview approach to gather qualitative information
  to address evaluation questions. The evaluation team conducted separate FGDs with
  the staff of Legacy Foundations and anonymous electronic surveys through the Google
  Forms online platform to collect information from a broader group of stakeholders
  in Romania and Hungary. The evaluation team successfully condensed challenges, successes,
  and recommendations for 10 Funds and 9 Foundations into a single, cohesive report,
  and has worked closely with the Bureau for Europe and Eurasia to finalize a product
  for several USAID Missions and Fund and Foundation stakeholders.
