DevTech fielded a two-person Evaluation Team (including a Team Leader from the US and an Egyptian expert) to determine the quality of program delivery in reference to the stated program goals and program indicators, characteristics of the students selected, program sustainability, and cost effectiveness. The Team provided summary findings, documented key lessons learned, and identified recommended adjustments in program implementation, including methods for improving LEAD in the short-term and long-term, as well as ways to replicate the program within Egypt and beyond.
