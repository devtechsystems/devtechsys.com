Brief Description: "DevTech conducted a comprehensive review of each training project undertaken by USAID/South Africa since its inception in the early 1980s. DevTech made a determination of Mission goals for a follow-on program through interviews with Mission officials; assessed the needs of the recipients through interviews with returned participants; and analyzed the status of follow-on activities with regard to policy requirements. The team evaluated NGOs working in South Africa for the purpose of determining their interest in participation, their capacity to effectively participate, and ways various NGOs could work together to assist the Mission in carrying out its training objectives.\r\nBased upon the findings, DevTech recommended an implementation plan that appropriately and creatively utilized all available resources; fostered effective networking at a minimum cost; emphasized the quality of contacts rather than the quantity; and incorporated the specific needs and circumstances of USAID/South Africa."
