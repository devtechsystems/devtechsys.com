USAID/Mexico was tasked with preparing an interim strategic framework (2012-2013) prior to the development of a CDCS. The Mission sought to integrate gender during the initial concept phase for this interim strategic framework and to assist in the implementation of the framework. Thus, the Mission proposed a three-phase activity. Phase 1 was a desk study that reviewed the literature on gender in Mexico in two primary areas: Climate Change and Resilient Communities (Citizen Security). Phase 2 included a gender analysis of four objectives: Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Economic Competitiveness, Crime and Violence Mitigation, and Criminal Justice Reforms. In Phase 3, a team of two trainers (one USAID and one task order) conducted a gender workshop for Mission staff.
