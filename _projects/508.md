Brief Discription: >-
  USAID/Mexico was tasked with preparing an interim strategic framework
  (2012-2013) prior to the development of a CDCS. The Mission sought to
  integrate gender during the initial concept phase for this interim strategic
  framework and to assist in the implementation of the framework. Thus, the
  Mission proposed a three-phase activity. Phase 1 was a desk study that
  reviewed the literature on gender in Mexico in two primary areas: Climate
  Change and Resilient Communities (Citizen Security). Phase 2 included a gender
  analysis of four objectives: Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Economic
  Competitiveness, Crime and Violence Mitigation, and Criminal Justice Reforms.
  In Phase 3, a team of two trainers (one USAID and one task order) conducted a
  gender workshop for Mission staff.
