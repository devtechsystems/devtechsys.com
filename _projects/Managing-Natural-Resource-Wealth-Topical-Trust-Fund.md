Brief Description: DevTech undertook an evaluation, designed to focus on efficiency,
  effectiveness and continued relevance of the Managing Natural Resource Wealth Topical
  Trust Fund (MNRW TTF) launched by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with the
  aim of improving operations through the end of the cycle. The evaluation cover launched,
  underway and completed activities covering a three-year period, 34 country programs,
  five research projects and four workshops. Because the evaluation covered activities
  that had been implemented three year prior, the emphases included learning aspects
  and accountability considerations, emerging impacts, and factors affecting expected
  impacts. The evaluation methodology was designed as a bottom-up approach where each
  project was assessed using questions grouped according to the DAC criteria. The
  questions were customized to reflect the features of the TTF and the characteristics
  of the countries receiving TTF TA. The team developed an evaluation matrix to demonstrate
  linkages between key evaluation questions and data sources and then processed and
  analyzed information collected from a variety of sources including project proposals
  and project assessments, including baseline information and quantitative and qualitative
  indicators; mid-year and annual reports produced by MNRW TTF, the logical framework
  and relevant financial data; feedback from IMF staff and experts, SC members and
  staff of relevant institutions in selected beneficiary countries; findings of the
  Fiscal Analysis of Resource Industries (FARI); macroeconomic and statistical data
  and analysis produced by the IMF Statistics and area departments as relevant; and
  country visits to Kenya, Mongolia and Tanzania. Findings were then triangulated
  to ensure consistency and validity.
