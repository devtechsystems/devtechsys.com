As a follow-up to the Immediate Recovery Project in Panama (USAID 1990-1991), DevTech provided long-term support to the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy (MIPPE). This assistance was divided into two components.The first component involved provision of a long-term, resident senior macroeconomic advisor to MIPPE for policy reform and implementation. This macroeconomist advised on liberalization policies, assisted the government with restoring access to assistance from international financial institutions, and reviewed macroeconomic projections and general economic and business conditions in light of targets of the economic program.The second component of the project called for short-term technical assistance in specific areas to facilitate the implementation of the economic program. Illustrative short-term technical assistance tasks included:Financial equilibrium in social security pension plans;Budget policy and administration;Reduction and eventual elimination of barriers to free trade;Privatization;Elimination of price controls;Cost analysis of health care services delivered by the government; andPublic-sector investment planning.This project also continued the public education program to raise the level of economic understanding in support of policy reform initiated during the Immediate Recovery Project.Task #01: External Debt AssistanceTask #02: Price SurveyTask #03: Support to the Implementation of the Economic Program, Agriculture SectorTask #04: Health Study—Separation of CostsTask #05: Actuarial Protection of Old Age and HandicappedTask #06: Discussion at the World Bank in Washington, D.C.Task #07: Price RegulationTask #08: Banco Hipotecario Nacional (BHN) StudyTask #09: Implementation of the Technical Assistance ProgramTask #10: Terms of Reference for a Study on Task #11: Study of the Competitiveness of the Panamanian Dairy IndustryTask #12: Study of the Competitiveness of the Panamanian Sugar IndustryTask #13: Study of the Competitiveness of the Panamanian Tomato IndustryTask #14: Public Sector PensionsTask #15: Consumer ProtectionTask #16: Terms of Reference: Irrigation StudyTask #17: Effective ProtectionTask #18: Terms of Reference: BHN – Banco de Desarrollo Agropecuario (BDA)Task #19: Economic Integration Study (2nd Part)Task #20: Study of the Agribusiness IndustryTask #21: Support to the Department of Labor and Social Welfare: Study of Labor CodesTask #22: World Bank MissionTask #23: Investment Planning DesignTask #24: BDATask #25: Preparation of the Public Investments TaskTask #26: Preparation of the BDA TaskTask #27: Preparation of the BHN Task
