Brief Description: 'In January 2013, DevTech was awarded a $14.7 million 5-year contract
  to provide set up and manage USAID/Guatemala’s Monitoring and Evaluation Program.
  This contract will provide activity-level monitoring and evaluation services designed
  to provide qualitative and/or quantitative analyses and reviews of specific Mission
  activities and programs. DevTech is the prime holder of a mission-wide Monitoring
  and Evaluation support contract for USAID that provides ongoing technical assistance
  and monitoring and evaluation support to the USAID Economic Growth Office (EGO).
  The program contributes to shaping longer-term strategic direction and decision
  making, particularly regarding the implementation of the Feed the Future and Global
  Climate Change initiatives. The program’s ultimate goal is to develop a monitoring
  and evaluation (M&E) mechanism that provides continued performance monitoring, verification
  and impact evaluation of program results, including environmental compliance. DevTech
  has provided USAID with the M&E services that increased the U.S. Government’s effectiveness
  in implementing its new strategy, while strengthening and institutionalizing local
  capacity in M&E. The program components consisted of: (1) designing statistical
  tools for baseline, mid- and final-term data collection; (2) developing local capacity
  of Guatemalan institutions for M&E; (3) establishing a clearinghouse for M&E; (4)
  conducting evaluations and ensuring the reporting of the results; and (5) providing
  M&E services to other USAID/Guatemala offices.'
