DevTech is tasked with undertaking the final performance review of the Reducing Incidence of Child Labor and Harmful Conditions of Work in Economic Strengthening Initiatives (RICHES), funded by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking, and implemented by the Grameen Foundation with the American Bar Association Rule of Law Initiative. RICHES has developed a toolkit aimed at preventing child labor by working within women’s economic empowerment (WEE) initiatives. While the interventions and tools developed by the project are intended for global application, the final performance evaluation will focus on the relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability of the RICHES project in El Salvador and the Philippines, where child labor and unacceptable conditions of work are entrenched issues.
