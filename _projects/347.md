This was a follow-on activity to the gender assessment. A workshop was held for 21 gender specialists from the various USAID implementing organizations. The workshop covered how to incorporate gender in the program design as well as an analysis of existing USAID indicators to identify where sub-indicators could be developed to monitor and evaluate program impact on gender.
