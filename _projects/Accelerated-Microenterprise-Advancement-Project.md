Project Title: Accelerated Microenterprise Advancement Project
Start Year: '2002'
End Year: '2006'
ISO3 Code:
  - GTM
Region: Latin America and the Caribbean
Country: Guatemala
Client/ Donor: USAID
Brief Description: >-
  DevTech deployed a team that used in-depth field interviews and a survey of
  buyers and producers, to take a “bottom-up” perspective to investigate the
  nature, determinants, and consequences of MSE participation in the textile
  handicrafts and high-value horticulture value chains in Guatemala. The
  evaluation team empirically tested the characteristics of value chain linkages
  that facilitate or inhibit the formation of collaborative inter-firm
  relationships, both vertically (between firms at different levels of the value
  chain) and horizontally (among firms at the same level of the value chain).
  This was followed by an analysis of the impact of these vertical and
  horizontal relationships on MSE owners’ ability to innovate, or upgrade, their
  enterprise. The results indicated the importance of market information,
  inter-firm communication, reduced transaction costs, risk-offsetting
  opportunities, and effective group governance in building strong horizontal
  and vertical relationships that promote MSE upgrading and enhance the
  competitiveness of value chains.
