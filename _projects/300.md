The focus of this consultancy was to examine the Civic and Voter Education Program for the mainstreaming and sensitization to gender, disability and other marginalized groups (to be determined during the consultancy). The main tasks were to: 1) meet with all implementing and funding partners of the ESC (and others identified as relevant) to ascertain expectations and assess current mainstreaming of gender, disability and minority related issues and activities; 2) conduct a “how to” training workshop with all ESC partners (and others identified as relevant); 3) conduct follow-up meetings with NGOs (including the ESC partners and others identified as relevant) to plan next steps/future activities; and 4) compile a report containing an assessment of gender mainstreaming, disability and minority sensitization in current ESC activities, and recommendations on the development of general strategies and partner-specific guidelines for the integration of gender, disability and minority issues into future programming.
