Brief Description: 'DevTech prepared a concept paper that critically reviewed the
  educational climate in six countries in the Latin America/Caribbean region (Costa
  Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama). The
  paper''s central thesis was that a crisis existed in the educational systems of
  the countries of the region that adversely affected the human resource endowment
  of the societies. This phenomenon, comparable in terms of economic consequences
  to the destruction of the rain forest, had far-reaching implications for the economic
  and social development prospects of the region. In its discussion of the educational
  crisis, the paper addressed financial constraints, the dilemma of quality versus
  coverage, and dependence on external financial resources. Reform was suggested on
  the following fronts: priority of educational policy, institutional reform of education
  ministries, improved teacher salaries, decentralized administrative functions, and
  increased effectiveness and sustainability of international assistance.'
