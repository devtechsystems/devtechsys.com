The gender assessment was requested to help guide gender integration in Mission programs and compliance with Agency directives for gender. The Mission identified three broad objectives, with a strong focus on rural areas: Economic Growth (primarily agriculture and forestry), DG (municipal strengthening and decentralization), and Investing in People (health, education, and food security). A team of three senior consultants (one US and two part-time Guatemalan) conducted the assessment, which included a series of recommendations and a draft gender action plan for the Mission.
