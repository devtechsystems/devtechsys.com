The workshop was held on March 20-23, 2012 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It was an outgrowth of an eighteen month process to identify key gender issues in the East Africa region as part of USAID/East Africa’s (USAID/EA) development of its Feed the Future multi-year strategy. The workshop was jointly supported by the USAID Washington’s Office of Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment (GenDev) and USAID/EA Office of Regional Economic Growth and Integration (REGI) and implemented by DevTech Systems, Inc. (DevTech) under the Short- Short-Term Technical Assistance and Training Task Order (Contract Number GEW-I-01-02-00019-00).The first phase of work consisted of a desk study that provided an overview of gender issues related to agriculture and climate change.1 The second phase involved interviewing stakeholders in East Africa, identifying the capabilities of potential partners, and considering possible programming options in light of the new strategic directions being developed by USAID/EA/REGI. This investigation was captured in a second report.2 The workshop constituted the final phase of the task order including dissemination of the two volumes of the report and the presentation of a gender integration training workshop.3The 46 workshop attendees represented seven East African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda). In addition to staff members from USAID/Washington, USAID/EA, and these seven field missions, the workshop included USAID partners: NGOs, private sector firms, and international organizations.
