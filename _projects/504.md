description: >-
  The workshop was held on March 20-23, 2012 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. It was
  an outgrowth of an eighteen month process to identify key gender issues in the
  East Africa region as part of USAID/East Africa’s (USAID/EA) development of
  its Feed the Future multi-year strategy. The workshop was jointly supported by
  the USAID Washington’s Office of Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment
  (GenDev) and USAID/EA Office of Regional Economic Growth and Integration
  (REGI) and implemented by DevTech Systems, Inc. (DevTech) under the Short-
  Short-Term Technical Assistance and Training Task Order (Contract Number
  GEW-I-01-02-00019-00).The first phase of work consisted of a desk study that
  provided an overview of gender issues related to agriculture and climate
  change.1 The second phase involved interviewing stakeholders in East Africa,
  identifying the capabilities of potential partners, and considering possible
  programming options in light of the new strategic directions being developed
  by USAID/EA/REGI. This investigation was captured in a second report.2 The
  workshop constituted the final phase of the task order including dissemination
  of the two volumes of the report and the presentation of a gender integration
  training workshop.3The 46 workshop attendees represented seven East African
  countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda).
  In addition to staff members from USAID/Washington, USAID/EA, and these seven
  field missions, the workshop included USAID partners: NGOs, private sector
  firms, and international organizations.
