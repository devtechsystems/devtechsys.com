USAID (2002â€“2012)DevTech was the prime contractor for this task order to provide on-demand short-term technical assistance (STTA) and training (STTA&T) to USAID Missions and Bureaus across sectors. DevTech assisted USAID to develop strategies for incorporating and addressing gender concerns in all activities and to provide sector- specific guidelines for integration of gender issues into development activities. DevTech conducted gender training focused on strategic planning, performance measurement, data collection and analysis tools, and monitoring and evaluation.  DevTech responded to more than 100 USAID Mission requests for assistance covering all sectors in evaluation, gender analysis, gender integration, training, and dissemination (through conferences). For these tasks, DevTech hired more than 75 individuals to deliver technical assistance. In all cases, the firm recruited international and local experts.
