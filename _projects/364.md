DevTech administered technical support to USAID's Bureau of Europe and Eurasia to aid the Bureau with its EnvironmentalCompliance Support Services project (2005-2008). Continuing the the work DevTech started in 2002, the project encouraged Washington and field-based staff and partners complete requirements of USAID environmental regulations regarding environmental impacts of U.S.-funded  activities in other countries, including 22cfr216, commonly referred to as \"Reg. 216\".
