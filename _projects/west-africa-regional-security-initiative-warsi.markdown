The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) developed the WARSI in response to the increase in cocaine trafficking through West Africa and organized crime in the region. To evaluate the effectiveness of WARSI, DevTech will assemble data that can be used as a reliable baseline for the WARSI program goals starting from October 1, 2011, with the intent to show significant empirically identifiable change - beneficial or otherwise - in these program goal areas for the fiscal years 2012 to 2015. The focus of this task order shall primarily be four West African countries: Benin, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Democracy International is our partner for this evaluation.
