The purpose of USAID Education Data Activity under the ABE-ACR IDIQ mechanism is to provide distinct assessment, data management, and research and evaluation services to monitor and track the progress of USAID’s Let’s Read Zambia. Among the main tasks of this contract are the completion of two Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) for children in Grade 2. The period of performance is from April 2018 thru September 2021.

These activities will be done in complete collaboration with USAID/Zambia, the Ministry of General Education (MOGE), the Examination Council of Zambia (ECZ), and other key stakeholders.
