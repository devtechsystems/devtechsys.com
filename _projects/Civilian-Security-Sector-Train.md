Under this contract, DevTech is undertaking a performance evaluation that focuses on CT and INL assistance to Tunisian civilian law enforcement entities, including but not limited to the Brigade Antiterrorisme (BAT), the National Unit for the Investigation of Terrorist Crimes (UNECT), the Brigade d’Ordre Public (BOP) and BIMOP, the Brigade Nationale d’Intervention Rapide (BNIR), the Commandos, and the Counterterrorism Fusion Center. DevTech evaluation experts are evaluating the results of CT and INL interventions, measuring for the success and effectiveness of TOT and other methodologies advanced by CT and INL. DevTech is employing a mixed methods approach, deriving valuable data from a variety of data collection techniques, which will derive data from KIIs with a wide range of stakeholders and beneficiaries, to arranging FGDs and survey distribution. Precisely, the team is delivering the evaluation in three (3) distinct phases: 
* Phase One - Washington Based Data Collection and Desk Review: The first phase of the Tunisian ToT Evaluation explored current CT and INL assistance provided to Tunisian civilian law enforcement entities. Phase One was designed to supply CT with actionable recommendations that assist decision makers with addressing assistance deficiencies and identifying opportunities for assistance optimization. 
* Phase Two - Field Work and Data Collection: DevTech traveled to Tunisia to perform a wide variety of data collection activities including structured direct observation to occur during field work, as well as key informant interviews, survey distribution, and focus group discussions. 
* Phase Three – Evaluation Report Development and Delivery:  Upon returning from field work, DevTech staff is aggregating, cleaning, and coding data in preparation for rigorous data analysis that analyze both quantitative and qualitative data to answer the above evaluation questions.
