  to restore stability and build the quality of the public education system in the
  period immediately following the January 2011 revolution. At the conclusion of the
  ESP (January 31, 2015), USAID/Egypt contracted DevTech Systems Inc. (DevTech) and
  its subcontractor The QED Group, LLC (QED) to conduct the final performance evaluation
  of the program.  The evaluation objectives were: (1) to review analyze, and evaluate
  the effectiveness of USAID-funded ESP activities in achieving program objectives
  and completing deliverables; and, (2) to provide specific recommendations and lessons
  learned to ensure that future funding for capacity-building in the areas for Boards
  of Trustees (BOTs), teacher training, and remedial reading are directed to activities
  that have the highest potential to achieve improved and sustainable resultsEvaluation
  of CISP:To effectively implement the CIS evaluation, DevTech has partnered with
  QED to form the DevTech Team – an integrated team with combined knowledge of the
  local context of Egypt and successfully conducting evaluations in the education
  sector. To conduct this evaluation, the DevTech Team has nominated a combination
  of home office staff, and both American and Egyptian consultants with experience
  in evaluating higher education projects to effectively and efficiently carry out
  the evaluation.The purposes of this evaluation were to: (1) identify the Cairo Initiative’s
  strengths and weaknesses and make any corrections needed, (2) review, analyze, and
  evaluate the USAID-funded Cairo Initiative in terms of achieving program objectives,
  and (3) provide findings and recommendations to be used by the Government of Egypt
  and USAID to help in future designs of human capacity-building projects.For this
  performance evaluation, a mixed-methods approach was used to collect and analyze
  primary and secondary source data. The methods consisted of: a literature review,
  key informant interviews, group discussions, and an opinion survey. Data were triangulated
  and the team ensured that primary data took account of a set of variables (e.g.,
  type of organization). The evaluation team interviewed 97 from a range of CISP target
  organizations and stakeholder organizations. The team visited four targeted organizations
  including two universities and two ministries.  In addition, the team invited all
  alumni and current CISP scholars to respond to an online survey. A total of twelve
  Conclusions were generated to answer the Evaluation Questions. These twelve conclusions
  are supported by twenty (20) Findings distributed across the Evaluation Questions,
  and recommendations were provided.'
