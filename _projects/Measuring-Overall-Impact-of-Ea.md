Brief Description: Under the Measuring the Overall Impact of East Africa CVE Initiative,
  DevTech is designing and conducting an evaluation of the FY15 Counterterrorism Partnership
  Fund (CTPF) Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs in Kenya and Tanzania to
  measure the overall effect of collective programming on reducing engagement in and
  recruitment into VE activities in East Africa. DevTech is conducting a quasi-experimental
  impact evaluation (IE), specifically difference-in-difference with propensity score
  matching (DID+PSM) to measure the overall impact of CTPF programs in select regions
  in Kenya and Tanzania. DevTech is currently identifying appropriate communities
  to serve as comparison groups in both countries that are similar to beneficiary
  communities in terms of household-level observable characteristics – religion, age,
  gender, annual expenditures, education level, and rural vs. non-rural – as well
  as specific observable regional characteristics including known presence of violent
  extremist organizations and recent attacks.

Working with the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Conflict Stabilization Operations (CSO), DevTech is conducting a mixed-methods impact evaluation of the FY15 Counterterrorism Partnership Fund (CTPF) Countering Violent Extremism programming in select countries in East Africa. This evaluation will measure the collective effect of CTPF programming on reducing violent extremist (VE) recruitment and activity in targeted communities across the region.
 
The DevTech evaluation team is currently conducting both quantitative and qualitative data collection. Qualitative data collection includes key informant interviews and focus group discussions with community members and other key stakeholders. Quantitative data collection includes a household survey that captures respondent demographics, attitudes, and experiences with drivers of recruitment and activity. Survey data will be used to establish a panel dataset for end-line analysis.
