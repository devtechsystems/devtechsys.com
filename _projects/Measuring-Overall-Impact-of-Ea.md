Project Title: Measuring Overall Impact of East Africa CVE
Start Year: '2016'
End Year: '2017'
ISO3 Code:
- KEN
- TZA
Region: Africa
Country: Kenya, Tanzania
Client/ Donor: U.S. Department of State
Brief Description: Under the Measuring the Overall Impact of East Africa CVE Initiative,
  DevTech is designing and conducting an evaluation of the FY15 Counterterrorism Partnership
  Fund (CTPF) Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs in Kenya and Tanzania to
  measure the overall effect of collective programming on reducing engagement in and
  recruitment into VE activities in East Africa. DevTech is conducting a quasi-experimental
  impact evaluation (IE), specifically difference-in-difference with propensity score
  matching (DID+PSM) to measure the overall impact of CTPF programs in select regions
  in Kenya and Tanzania. DevTech is currently identifying appropriate communities
  to serve as comparison groups in both countries that are similar to beneficiary
  communities in terms of household-level observable characteristics – religion, age,
  gender, annual expenditures, education level, and rural vs. non-rural – as well
  as specific observable regional characteristics including known presence of violent
  extremist organizations and recent attacks.
