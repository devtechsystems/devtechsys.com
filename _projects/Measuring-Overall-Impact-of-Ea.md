Brief Description: Under the Measuring the Overall Impact of East Africa CVE Initiative,
  DevTech is designing and conducting an evaluation of the FY15 Counterterrorism Partnership
  Fund (CTPF) Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs in Kenya and Tanzania to
  measure the overall effect of collective programming on reducing engagement in and
  recruitment into VE activities in East Africa. DevTech is conducting a quasi-experimental
  impact evaluation (IE), specifically difference-in-difference with propensity score
  matching (DID+PSM) to measure the overall impact of CTPF programs in select regions
  in Kenya and Tanzania. DevTech is currently identifying appropriate communities
  to serve as comparison groups in both countries that are similar to beneficiary
  communities in terms of household-level observable characteristics – religion, age,
  gender, annual expenditures, education level, and rural vs. non-rural – as well
  as specific observable regional characteristics including known presence of violent
  extremist organizations and recent attacks.

DevTech is working with the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Conflict Stabilization Operations (CSO), conducting a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental impact evaluation of the FY15 Counterterrorism Partnership Fund (CTPF) Countering Violent Extremism programming in select countries in Kenya and Tanzania. This evaluation will measure the collective effect of CTPF programming on reducing violent extremist (VE) recruitment and activity in targeted communities across the region.

DevTech completed the baseline evaluation in December of 2017, which included administering a household survey at the county level, recording demographic data such as household income, education levels, employment status, ethnic/tribal affiliation, and religious affiliation as well as 14 indicators of potential VE drivers. To supplement the quantitative data, DevTech also conducted key informant interviews and focus group discussions with community leaders, religious leaders, and members of the police. DevTech completed the midline qualitative evaluation in October of 2018, after conducting qualitative data collection across the eight relevant counties in Kenya and Tanzania. The endline evaluation is scheduled to be conducted at the end of 2019.
