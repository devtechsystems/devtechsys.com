Brief Description: Under the Measuring the Overall Impact of East Africa CVE Initiative,
  DevTech is designing and conducting an evaluation of the FY15 Counterterrorism Partnership
  Fund (CTPF) Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs in Kenya and Tanzania to
  measure the overall effect of collective programming on reducing engagement in and
  recruitment into VE activities in East Africa. DevTech is conducting a quasi-experimental
  impact evaluation (IE), specifically difference-in-difference with propensity score
  matching (DID+PSM) to measure the overall impact of CTPF programs in select regions
  in Kenya and Tanzania. DevTech is currently identifying appropriate communities
  to serve as comparison groups in both countries that are similar to beneficiary
  communities in terms of household-level observable characteristics – religion, age,
  gender, annual expenditures, education level, and rural vs. non-rural – as well
  as specific observable regional characteristics including known presence of violent
  extremist organizations and recent attacks.

In the catchment area of treatment communities, i.e. communities in which CTPF programming is present, a household survey is administered orally to gather information from a randomly selected household member. Questions capture demographic data, perceptions of economic marginalization and political freedom, and other sensitive questions on levels of vulnerability. Data from these surveys is used to identify whether communities are actually benefiting from CTPF interventions. In addition to this quantitative data collection, DevTech has also conducted key informant interviews and focus group discussions with community members for qualitative analysis.
