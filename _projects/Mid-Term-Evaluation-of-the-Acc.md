title: Mid Term Evaluation Of The Acc
Project Title: Mid-Term Evaluation of the Accelerated Learning Program for Positive
  Living and United Service (ALPP)
Start Year: '2008'
End Year: '2008'
ISO3 Code:

Region: Africa
Country: Liberia
Client/ Donor: USAID
Brief Description: 'DevTech conducted a mid-term review of the Accelerated Learning
  Program for Positive Living and United Service (ALPP) for USAID/Liberia.Introduced
  in 2006, the ALPP was part of the broader Liberian Accelerated Learning Program
  (ALP).  ALP was developed in 1998 with the goal of meeting the educational needs
  of primary school drop-outs and over-aged children and youth, by enabling them to
  complete their primary education in three years (Levels 1-III vs. Grades 1-6). At
  the time of the evaluation, the ALP was implemented in 10 counties by 11 implementing
  partners.The Evaluation Team dedicated three months in Liberia to assess:The coverage
  and impact of the USAID-funded ALPP intervention after 18 months of implementation;
  andThe relative efficacy and appropriateness of the overall ALP model for students
  aged 15 and older as implemented by the 11 partner agencies.The evaluation design
  included classroom observations, focus groups, and student testing.The Evaluation
  Team traveled to the six counties where ALPP was implemented, visiting a total of
  18 school sites and covering the educational programs of the USAID-implemented ALPP,
  Partner-implemented ALPs, and MoE-run Conventional Primary School Grades 1-6. Data
  was collected through 39 classroom observations as well as focus groups/interviews
  that were carried out with a number of stakeholders, which included: Ministry of
  Education personnel, partner organizations, County and District Education Officers,
  principals, community members, Parent-Teacher Associations, youth groups and students.To
  assess the learning outcomes of ALP students and determine the overall effectiveness
  of the program, the Team developed and administered assessment instruments in Mathematics
  and Language Arts for ALP Levels II and III. The exams were designed to assess proficiency
  in specific skills such as subtraction, division, use of pronouns, and comprehension.
  To provide comparative data, the tests were also administered to students in MoE
  Grades 3 and 5 and to students in ALP partner programs. In total, 806 students were
  tested by the DevTech team.To complement the evaluation aspects of the assignment,
  DevTech delivered three capacity building workshops to staff of the implementing
  partners and other Liberian educators.  The purpose was to increase the capacity
  of ALP Implementing Partners to develop instructional assessments to collect and
  use data on ALP student learning outcomes to improve the ability to collect, manage,
  and analyze data through improved database skills, and to develop a common monitoring
  tool and reliable database for ALP/ALPP programs.'
