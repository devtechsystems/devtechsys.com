description: >-
  As part of a World Bank Technical Assistance Loan for structural adjustment,
  DevTech assessed various aspects of the public health care system and the
  pension regimes of Costa Rica. DevTech evaluated the internal efficiency of
  the health care system, its long-term economic and financial viability,
  alternatives for improving outpatient services, and the integration of
  preventive and curative services. One of the objectives was to study the
  possibility of increasing the role of preventive rather than curative services
  to reduce the overall costs of the national health care system. The project
  included formulation of a quantitative model of health planning aimed at
  simulating and projecting future resource needs (derived from epidemiological
  transitions and improvements in managerial conditions). DevTech's team of
  consultants for this aspect of the project included experts in macroeconomics
  and microeconomics, sociology, public health, epidemiology, institutional
  analysis, and statistical and quantitative analysis. In the area of social
  security, DevTech examined the financial viability of the various pension
  regimes, their impact on the national budget, the feasibility of integrating
  them, and political alternatives aimed at lessening the fiscal burden the
  country was facing.
