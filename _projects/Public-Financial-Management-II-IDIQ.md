  PFM II Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) is a Bureau-wide
  mechanism that supports USAID’s Bureau for Economic Growth, Education and

  goal of achieving broad-based equitable economic growth: (1) increasing and
  expanding human capacity; (2) improving the policy environment to promote
  efficiency and economic opportunity for all members of society; (3) sound
  management of institutions; and (4) good governance. PFM II IDIQ provides
  support for the public sector in developing countries that USAID serves. When
  governments have sound, effective, transparent, genderaware and accountable
  systems in place to manage public funds, there is a decrease in opportunities
  for corruption, inefficiencies and mismanagement. Sound public financial
  management systems canfacilitate:  o Good governance practices;o Access to
  useful, accurate public information for better decision-making; ando Systems
  that complement each other across governmental entities (e.g., tax collection,
  customs,and procurements).
