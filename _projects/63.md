Brief Discription: >-
  In response to an urgent request by the government of Hungary for assistance
  to strengthen the national market's acceptance of its financial securities,
  DevTech dispatched a technical advisory team to Budapest. The DevTech team
  conducted a broad economic analysis of the problem to determine the causes for
  poor market reception of government securities. Coordinating closely with U.S.
  Department of Treasury advisors to the government of Hungary, the DevTech team
  conferred with high-ranking officials in the Ministry of Finance and other
  Hungarian government institutions and with leaders of the private banking
  community and other key private-sector entities. DevTech identified steps that
  the Hungarian government could take to enhance its capability to sell
  government securities to the public, analyzed the economic consequences, and
  recommended strategies for immediate and follow-on interventions.
