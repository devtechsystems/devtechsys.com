DevTech, under subcontract to World Education, Inc., provided technical assistance to the Improved Quality of Education Activity in Mali. Funded by USAID, the project aimed to achieve maximum impact toward improving educational quality in a resource poor environment. The technical assistance had three components:1) Improving teacher learning and performance through the implementation of a school cluster system in conjunction with the Ministry of Education (MOE);2) Providing the MOE with the technical expertise, particularly in mathematics, science, and life skills, to create and implement a curriculum best suited to the needs of Malians; and3) Working with parents and communities to improve their management of schools, monitoring of quality (in partnership with the MOE), and advocacy/mobilization of resources.
