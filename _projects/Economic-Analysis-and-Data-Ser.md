  the Chief Information Officer's initiative to provide U.S. Agency for International
  Development (USAID) employees with quick and easy access to development data and
  quantitative analytical support. EADS maintains several specialized websites, which
  provide access to thousands of statistical series covering all aspects of the development
  process along with data analysis tools.In September 2013, DevTech was awarded an
  add-on to the EADS project. The Microenterprise Accountability and Results Tracking
  Activity is a four-year activity designed to assist USAID/E3 office to respond to
  the congressionally-mandated reporting on the status of the agency's microenterprise
  work each year, while also making the information collected publicly available.The
  EADS Websites include the Trade Capacity Building Database, the U.S. Official Development

DevTech has been the prime contractor for the Economic Analysis and Data Services (EADS), an information system providing macro-level international economic and social statistical data to the USG for four successive $18 million, five-year contracts. The Economic Analysis and Data Services is USAID’s central source for U.S. foreign assistance data, international socioeconomic data, and data-driven analysis in support of USAID goals. EADS manages four databases, each with a public website (https://eads.usaid.gov), containing data from across the Agency, U.S. Government, and international development organizations. EADS generates the data in three of the four databases through data calls to USG agencies, different parts of USAID and USAID partners. The fourth database collects international socioeconomic data from reputable sources and makes them available to USAID, its partners and the public, through unique data visualizations and tools on one convenient site. The four databases are the following:
* Foreign Aid Database - This database is the basis for the US government annual reporting of foreign assistance data to Congress (the Greenbook), as well as US government’s annual reporting to the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (USAAR: U.S. Government’s Annual Assistance Report). It contains all US government foreign assistance data from 1946 to the present. 
* Trade Capacity Building Database - reports all trade capacity building  activities from the U.S. government
* Microenterprise Results Reporting Database - source of data for USAID's reporting of its microenterprise supporting activities in compliance with the Microenterprise Results and Accountability Act (MRAA) of 2004.
* Economic and Social Database - collects country level economic and social data from around the world, from sources such as the World Bank, IMF, UN agencies, and US government sources as well (e.g. USAID’s Demographic and Health Surveys). It brings these sources into one location on the International Data and Economic Analysis website,  and makes them easily assessable to USAID staff, facilitating identification of appropriate and updated data. 

Further, EADS has launched a new Country Dashboard, which is an interactive data visualization tool that allows USAID staff to compare a country with selected groups of countries and assess its progress over time. The Dashboard compares countries across eight sectors, 45 subsectors, and 335 indicators, all of which are also housed on the International Data and Economic Analysis (IDEA) website. The Dashboard provides the most-up-to-date data across sectors. It shows selected indicators for countries that USAID assists, benchmarked against regional data or data for countries of similar income. Users can compare country values with income groups and regional averages, or view the trend line and ranking of a specific indicator. The country dashboard brings several benefits to our IDEA website: it allows users to benchmark data against regional averages and the average of countries of similar income; it adds visual appeal; and it provides users with a selected subset
EADS is also responsible for providing the Finding and Using Development Data (FUDD) training to USAID staff, which is offered three times per year in Arlington, VA. EADS recently produced an online version of the class, which is now available to all USAID staff and used primarily in the field at USAID’s missions. USAID staff from all sectors and bureaus use FUDD to better understand, analyze, and visualize the wealth of development date available in their specific line of work.
