Brief Description: "In response to an urgent request by the government of Hungary for assistance to strengthen the national market's acceptance of its financial securities, DevTech dispatched a technical advisory team to Budapest. The DevTech team conducted a broad economic analysis of the problem to determine the causes for poor market reception of government securities. Coordinating closely with U.S. Department of Treasury advisors to the government of Hungary, the DevTech team conferred with high-ranking officials in the Ministry of Finance and other Hungarian government institutions and with leaders of the private banking community and other key private-sector entities. DevTech identified steps that the Hungarian government could take to enhance its capability to sell government securities to the public, analyzed the economic consequences, and recommended strategies for immediate and follow-on interventions.\r\n\r\n"
