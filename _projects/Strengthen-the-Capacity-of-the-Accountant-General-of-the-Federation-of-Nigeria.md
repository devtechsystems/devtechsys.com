Brief Description: >-
  This project sought to build the capacity of the Office of the Accountant
  General of the Federation (AGF) and Auditor General's Office (AGO) to use an
  electronic Transaction Recording and Reporting System (TRRS) developed with
  assistance from the World Bank and IMF. At the beginning of the project, 51 of
  the 105 government ministries, departments, and agencies and none of the
  federal payroll offices were using the TRRS to submit timely accounts. The
  project aimed to change the business practices of branches of the federal
  government so they would integrate the TRRS into their operations,
  strengthening the capacity of the AGF to complete the consolidation of
  accounting information from all Ministries and agencies in a timely manner,
  and ensuring that consolidated data was used to perform real-time audits.
  Trainings enhanced accountants’ capacity to enter information into the TRRS
  and auditors’ capacity both in the AGF and AGO to perform real-time audits of
  government agencies, offices, aid Ministries.As part of this initiative,
  DevTech developed an organizational change management (OCM) strategy for the
  TRRS, and worked with other project team members to implement it. The purpose
  of the OCM strategy was to ensure that all system users were fully aware of
  the changes taking place as a result of the new system, and understood their
  respective roles in the organization.
