Project Title: >-
  Environmental Information Systems and Networking (EISN) in Serbia and
  Montenegro
Start Year: '1997'
End Year: '2002'
ISO3 Code: ''
Region: Europe and Eurasia
Country: Serbia & Montenegro
Client/ Donor: USAID
Brief Description: >-
  Under EISN, DevTech provided support to the Environment and Natural Resources
  (ENR) Division of the Bureau for Europe and Eurasia. The support ranged from
  assisting with management of Regulation 216 compliance to supporting EcoLinks
  (an environmental trade program). The EISN Project gave DevTech the
  opportunity to implement several different activities. Examples of these
  include:Biodiversity Assessments—DevTech provided technical expertise to the
  USAID Missions in Bulgaria and Serbia/Montenegro to develop strategic
  biodiversity assessments in conjunction with their five-year strategies.
  Country needs were identified and analyzed to provide concrete recommendations
  for strengthening the Missions' environmental portfolios.Technical Review of
  Biodiversity Assessments—DevTech performed a technical review and evaluation
  of the results of five assessments from the Central Asia Region conducted by
  another firm to ensure the thoroughness and accuracy of the environmental
  information and usefulness of the recommendations. During the review, DevTech
  identified several areas in the assessments where the Missions could introduce
  environmental themes into ongoing projects to help them be more
  cross-cutting.Assessment of Priority Issues Regarding Environmental Impacts of
  Land Privatization in Eastern Europe and Eurasia—A DevTech team of in-country
  and US-based specialists conducted an assessment of environmental impacts of
  land privatization activities in 15 transition countries in Eastern Europe and
  Eurasia. The field study, commissioned by the Environment and Natural
  Resources (ENR) Division of the Bureau for Europe and Eurasia, identified
  environmental impacts, both positive and negative, of land privatization in
  the region, and outlined priority focal points for USAID during the ongoing
  land privatization process. The work was completed under tight deadlines
  within a two-month time frame.Report on Progress Made Toward Meeting the E&E
  Bureau Strategic Objective for Environment—The assessment of progress made
  toward achieving development goals is essential for the efficient design of
  environmental assistance programs. DevTech specialists took stock of
  developments in transition countries in Eastern Europe and Eurasia and
  evaluated the environmental performance of beneficiary countries in 1999,
  2000, and 2001. The analysis available in the Transition Report was used to
  evaluate the effectiveness of assistance programs in the region. ENR Division
  staff have used the information in these reports to provide briefing
  information to senior management at USAID. The reports also were used as an
  indicator of which countries were progressing sufficiently to allow a decrease
  in environmental program support.Analysis of Water and Wastewater Treatment
  Technologies Applicable to Eastern Europe—DevTech surveyed promising water and
  wastewater treatment technologies and prepared an analysis of their
  suitability in the E&E region. The firm conducted an extensive web search and
  surveyed more than 20 companies to determine which new technologies might be
  easily adapted in the region. The output of the report was provided to
  EcoLinks management to help it with strategy development during the following
  year.Technical Review of a Risk Assessment Methodology – DevTech reviewed a
  report intended for use as a risk assessment methodology primer. USAID used
  the review to require the report provide more focus on the methodology of risk
  assessment.Caspian Environmental Regulatory Partnership Program Workshop on
  Air Emission Regulation Development—DevTech provided expert technical
  assistance in implementing this workshop on air emissions and allowing for oil
  exploration in Kazakhstan. As part of facilitating the program, DevTech staff
  moderated the US-Kazakh workshop on implementing air pollution control
  permits. The meeting ended with general agreement that the working group
  approach to developing realistic regulatory reform had the potential to be
  effective.
