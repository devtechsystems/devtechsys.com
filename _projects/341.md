This was a follow-on activity to the earlier gender assessment. The U.S. gender expert (based in El Salvador) provided technical assistance and conducted training. Among the outcomes of this work was the preparation of a Gender Mission Order. Training sessions were carried out with each technical office and the Gender Committee to develop skills to support their respective Strategic Objective (SO) Teams (design, implementation, and evaluations).
