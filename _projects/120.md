DevTech performed a mid-term evaluation of the Nicaragua Basic Education Project (BASE). The three-person team evaluated the design, management, and implementation of the project under three major components: institutional strengthening, teacher training, and curriculum and instructional materials design. Among the recommendations made for the second phase of BASE were a move towards more student-oriented curricula and instructional methods and increased community participation in support of ongoing decentralization.
