Under an Inter-Agency Agreement with USAID, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission provide technical assistance to the Romanian Competition Office and Competition Council. In support of this effort, DevTech provided logistical and administrative assistance to U.S. government staff in Romania. This assistance included arranging housing for semi-permanent and visiting officials; providing interpreting and translating services; arranging for international and domestic travel and accommodations; and providing other assistance as required. DevTech established an office in Bucharest to ensure that all requests for assistance were met satisfactorily.
