Through a task order under the Evaluation IQC, DevTech conducted a mid-course evaluation of the progress and results attained by the pedagogical component of the Benin basic education reform program. This evaluation identified and analyzed the conformity, coherence, progress, and impact of the new curricula, pedagogical guides, the new Math and French workbooks and textbooks, French wall charts, teacher training, student assessment and school orientation, and documentary network. The findings and the observations provided crucial information to successfully guide the progress of the reform.
