A three-day workshop was held at the Mission in Lima, Peru. The content of cases included in the workshop was customized for the region, and included presentations from external panelists on Gender Budgeting Methodology and GBV. All participants made concrete commitments to follow-on actions. Five projects developed plans for integrating gender into their Performance Monitoring Plans (PMPs), work plans, or scopes of work for studies.
