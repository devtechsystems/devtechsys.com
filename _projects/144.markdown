Brief Description: >-
  The study finds that the impact of rural roads on agricultural markets and
  marketing activities, a strategic objective of the PNIR project, is
  considerable. Over the last three years, marketing traffic has increased
  sixfold, while the number of people in markets, the number of commercial
  vehicle operators, and the number of traders have all more than doubled. The
  number of tax tickets levied on markets has increased threefold, which clearly
  indicates an increase in the number of commercial transactions. The volume of
  agricultural products sold in markets has increased fivefold, and
  transportation time has decreased to one-sixth of what it was, since the
  average speed on improved roads has increased from 6 kilometers per hour (kdh)
  to 35 kdh. As a result,transportation costs have been cut in half for
  passengers as well as for commodities, and traffic is no longer halted during
  the rainy season. Villages that were totally cut off are now linked to the
  outside world yearround.
