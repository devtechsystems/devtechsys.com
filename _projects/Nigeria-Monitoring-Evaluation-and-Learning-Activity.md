  and implementing partners (IPs) on performance monitoring, data verification, impact
  and performance evaluations, project and activity level monitoring, evaluation and

  and Adapting Institutional Practice. TLP is also designed to support enhanced accountability
  and engagement with non-USAID stakeholders so that USAID can benefit from their
  perspectives through shared learning and problem solving that improves Mission results
  and achievement.
