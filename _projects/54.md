DevTech evaluated development and recurrent costs for the Radio Mathematics Learning Project \"La Familia de los Números\" in Honduras. Cost data were collected and analyzed for the program's initial four years to provide the basis for projecting three years of costs under different staffing and program content assumptions. Future cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated on the basis of these projections.
