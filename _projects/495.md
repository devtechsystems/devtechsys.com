As a prime contractor, DevTech conducted a mid-term performance evaluation of USAID/Jordan's Education Reform Support Project (ERSP) implemented by Creative Associates International, Inc. The ERSP supports the Jordan Ministry of Education's reform efforts to produce graduates with skills to compete in a knowledge economy across four components, including:>Early childhood education;>Youth, technology, and career development;>Improved professional development and certification; and>Increased capacity to manage school-based education programs.The mid-term evaluation measured the extent to which the project is achieving its objectives and the extent to which the project is progressing towards achieving its higher level impact results.DevTech utilized a mixed-methods approach, including: key informant interviews and focus groups, review of project-generated documentation and PMP indicator data supplemented by site visits, and field site visits to a stratified sample of schools and directorate offices in three regions across Jordan. Of note, DevTech developed an Organizational Development Ranking instrument to track Ministry of Education progress in ERSP-fostered education reforms and conducted a Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) Analysis of the changes in behavior of a sample of selected ERSP target beneficiary populations.Based on the major findings, DevTech identified gaps in programming, and made evidence-based recommendations that will inform project implementation for the remaining 2.5 years and assure sustainability of the interventions.
