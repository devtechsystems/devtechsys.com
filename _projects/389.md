The activity helped identify and raise awareness about a) methodological issues that need to be considered by future tools to correctly approximate the distribution of resources within households, b) how existing methodological approaches are addressing these issues and provided an evaluation of their usefulness, and c) conceptual approaches that can address these issues with accurate and user-friendly poverty assessment tools. The activity also ensured that the broad lessons learned about gender-sensitive implementation of household surveys were reflected in the manuals that accompanied the poverty assessment tools developed for certification by USAID.
