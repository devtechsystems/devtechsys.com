description: >-
  The activity helped identify and raise awareness about a) methodological
  issues that need to be considered by future tools to correctly approximate the
  distribution of resources within households, b) how existing methodological
  approaches are addressing these issues and provided an evaluation of their
  usefulness, and c) conceptual approaches that can address these issues with
  accurate and user-friendly poverty assessment tools. The activity also ensured
  that the broad lessons learned about gender-sensitive implementation of
  household surveys were reflected in the manuals that accompanied the poverty
  assessment tools developed for certification by USAID.
