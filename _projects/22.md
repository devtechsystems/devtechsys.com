Under a World Bank Technical Assistance Loan for structural adjustment, DevTech conducted a comprehensive study (in Spanish) of Costa Rica's general education system. DevTech's multi-disciplinary team included experts in economics, educational administration, anthropology, financial management, and distance education. This team assessed the following facets of education's role in economic development: internal efficiency of the primary and secondary education system; quality of instruction; curriculum content; community participation; future demand for educational services and long-term trends of educational costs and financing; and the feasibility of educational television for improving teaching methods.
