  A team of four gender specialists (three international and one Paraguayan)
  conducted a gender analysis of key sectors and workshop for USAID/Paraguay
  staff and partners. The original scope for the gender assessment was designed
  to inform the CDCS process. The CDCS was postponed so the team adjusted the
  analysis to be focused on potential development objectives. The team leader
  for the field work was the Paraguayan gender specialist, who had conducted two
  previous assignments under the task order.
