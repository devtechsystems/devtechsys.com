A team of four gender specialists (three international and one Paraguayan) conducted a gender analysis of key sectors and workshop for USAID/Paraguay staff and partners. The original scope for the gender assessment was designed to inform the CDCS process. The CDCS was postponed so the team adjusted the analysis to be focused on potential development objectives. The team leader for the field work was the Paraguayan gender specialist, who had conducted two previous assignments under the task order.
