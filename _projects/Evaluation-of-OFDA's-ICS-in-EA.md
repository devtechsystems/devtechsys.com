Brief Description: This project was a performance evaluation of the Incident Command
  System (ICS) program in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand managed by the
  United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA). The evaluation
  examined the program’s effectiveness and sustainability in building the capacity
  of local government agencies in the three countries to respond to natural disaster
  using ICS. The evaluation applied a mixed methods design, collecting data from document
  reviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and an online survey
  for ICS master trainers in the Philippines. Results show that the programs have
  identified the appropriate local government agencies to work with and ICS capacities
  are being built to varying degrees. Demand for training is high but USAID/OFDA and
  the United States Forest Service (USFS) trainers must consider contextualizing ICS
  principles and training content to make the system relevant to local agencies and
  communities. USAID/OFDA and USFS trainers also should consider conditions unique
  to each country, such as governance structures, to solicit the support of the local
  first responders’ community. The effectiveness and sustainability will also be better
  understood if local government agencies develop performance management plans to
  track the program’s effectiveness and sustainability.
