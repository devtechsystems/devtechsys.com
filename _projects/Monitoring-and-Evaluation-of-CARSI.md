Brief Description: 'For the INL’s Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI)
  task order, DevTech supported the Office of Western Hemisphere to develop a systematic
  data collection mechanism and procedure to facilitate the regular monitoring of
  CARSI programs and conducted evidence-based evaluations of program progress to determine
  the effectiveness in meeting goals and objectives, identify lessons learned, and
  provide timely analysis for effective management decisions. The evaluations focused
  on El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama. DevTech also developed the monitoring
  system using InfoPath so that it remains compliant with INL’s security and information
  technology system requirements. CARSI has implemented program activities aimed at
  three core outcomes: 1. Disrupting criminal infrastructure, routes, and networks;
  2. Building the capacity of law enforcement and justice sector actors and institutions
  to serve citizens and address regional threats3. Advancing community policing, gang
  prevention, and economic and social programming for at-risk youth in communities
  disproportionately impacted by crime.'

For the INL’s Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) task order, For INL’s Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) task order, DevTech conducted evidence-based evaluations of CARSI activities financed with International Narcotics and Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funds, administered by INL’s Office of Western Hemisphere Programs (INL/WHP), in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama from Fiscal Year 2009 to FY2016. During this period, the U.S. Congress appropriated $733.1 million in INCLE funds to INL/CARSI to help to strengthen Central American law enforcement and justice sector institutions; assist in countering organized crime; and advance community policing, gang prevention, and socioeconomic programs for at-risk communities. DevTech also developed a systematic monitoring and reporting system for these civilian security activities, adapted from the system DevTech developed for the [INL/CBSI evaluation](http://devtechsys.com/projects/Monitoring-and-Evaluation-of-t/) to support INL’s monitoring, analysis, and reporting activities as well as management decisions.
