ISO3 Code: ''
Region: Latin America and the Caribbean

Client/ Donor: USAID
Brief Discription: >-
  The purpose of the technical assistance was to work with Strategic Objective
  (SO) teams in the development of their strategies, assisting them in
  identifying gender issues, which are critical to the fulfilment of their SOs.
  The G/WID team members worked with their respective counterparts on SO teams
  to generate ideas on creative but realistic ways to integrate gender issues at
  all stages of strategic planning, implementation, and monitoring of the
  USAID/Haiti program. Each consultant asked relevant questions in group
  sessions and individual meetings to stimulate thinking and develop actions
  from a gender perspective. In doing so, G/WID team members helped each SO team
  understand the strategic importance of ensuring that gender issues are
  addressed in their customer survey, SO, intermediate results, and indicators
  to maximize the success of their strategic objective and the Mission goal.
