The purpose of the technical assistance was to work with Strategic Objective (SO) teams in the development of their strategies, assisting them in identifying gender issues, which are critical to the fulfilment of their SOs. The G/WID team members worked with their respective counterparts on SO teams to generate ideas on creative but realistic ways to integrate gender issues at all stages of strategic planning, implementation, and monitoring of the USAID/Haiti program. Each consultant asked relevant questions in group sessions and individual meetings to stimulate thinking and develop actions from a gender perspective. In doing so, G/WID team members helped each SO team understand the strategic importance of ensuring that gender issues are addressed in their customer survey, SO, intermediate results, and indicators to maximize the success of their strategic objective and the Mission goal.
