Brief Description: The cost incurred by the Superintendency of Tax Administration
  (SAT) in all aspects covered by the administration of the taxes that it administers
  is of fiscal, economic and social interest, since these costs represent a deduction
  of the gross yield of each tax. It is therefore important to make an effort to minimize
  this cost - without undermining the related efforts to strengthen tax collection.Simultaneously,
  the administrative cost estimate can play two additional roles:• Identify those
  taxes whose cost represents a relatively high proportion of their gross receipts;
  If so, it may be advisable or repeal such tribute or modify it so that its net collection
  increased.• Allow international comparisons as a useful tool for tax administrators
  and for those who forge tax policy, thus pointing to areas where administrative
  efficiency is needed.
