Brief Description: >-
  The purpose of the evaluation of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law
  Enforcement Affairs (INL) Rule of Law Programs in Colombia is to assess the
  effectiveness of the Justice Sector Reform Program (JSRP) relative to the
  goals and objectives in the planning documents. It is a retrospective
  evaluation, limited to program activities between 2008 and 2011. The primary
  audience for the evaluation is the INL Office of Western Hemisphere Programs
  in Washington and the INL section of the US Embassy in Colombi. The evaluation
  SOW calls for evidence-based findings and conclusions to assess the impact of
  the INL Justice Sector Reform Program in Colombia between 2008 and 2011. Given
  the diversity among the six evaluation questions and the range of project
  goals, the Evaluation Team used a mixed methods approach to elicit both
  qualitative and quantitative data drawn from multiple sources. To the extent
  that data were available, the evaluation used 2008 as the base year for
  identifying change across the four-year period. Analytically, to the extent
  possible, the evaluation used the technique of triangulation to validate
  findings by drawing on comparative data from two or more sources as evidence.
