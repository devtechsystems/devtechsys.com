Start Year: '2010'
End Year: '2010'
ISO3 Code: EGY
Region: Africa
Country: Egypt
Client/ Donor: USAID
Brief Discription: >-
  The USAID/Egypt requested assistance with an assessment of gender issues
  related to Avian Influenza (AI) in poultry production and humans, especially
  how they relate to food security, child malnutrition, poverty propagation and
  human infections, and to provide recommendations for activities that would
  mitigate AI while taking gender into account. The Mission had had activities
  to support the government of Egypt response to Avian Influenza for three
  years, with the intent to continue these programs into the future. The
  recommendations of the gender assessment were to be incorporated into the
  on-going programs. AI is now considered endemic in Egypt. Two consultants
  conducted the assessment in close collaboration with the implementing partners
  of the USAID activities.
