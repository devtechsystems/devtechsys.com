The USAID/Egypt requested assistance with an assessment of gender issues related to Avian Influenza (AI) in poultry production and humans, especially how they relate to food security, child malnutrition, poverty propagation and human infections, and to provide recommendations for activities that would mitigate AI while taking gender into account. The Mission had had activities to support the government of Egypt response to Avian Influenza for three years, with the intent to continue these programs into the future. The recommendations of the gender assessment were to be incorporated into the on-going programs. AI is now considered endemic in Egypt. Two consultants conducted the assessment in close collaboration with the implementing partners of the USAID activities.
