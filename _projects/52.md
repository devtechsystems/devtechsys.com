Within the context of a government-wide program of structural reforms, DevTech evaluated the feasibility of developing and installing a dynamic macroeconomic simulation model of the Salvadoran economy. The model was designed to strengthen USAID/El Salvador's ability to evaluate the distributional implications of economic policy alternatives and make recommendations in support of economic stabilization and preparation for medium-term growth and development.
