  The goal of the Databook is to gather and disseminate the most up-to-date
  information possible from official country sources, in addition to information
  provided by leading International Financial Institutions. We have attempted to
  select the most interesting and relevant indicators for assessing current
  trends in development. The presentation of many of the tables allows for
  comparisons to be made both across countries and time. If interpreted
  cautiously, these data present a useful picture of the state of socioeconomic
  development in the LAC region.
