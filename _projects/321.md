The goal of the Databook is to gather and disseminate the most up-to-date information possible from official country sources, in addition to information provided by leading International Financial Institutions. We have attempted to select the most interesting and relevant indicators for assessing current trends in development. The presentation of many of the tables allows for comparisons to be made both across countries and time. If interpreted cautiously, these data present a useful picture of the state of socioeconomic development in the LAC region.
