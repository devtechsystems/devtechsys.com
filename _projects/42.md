DevTech consultants conducted a critical review of the investment process in the Venezuelan public sector (central government and public enterprises) and developed a strategy to improve the different phases of the process. The review included the design and evaluation of projects, the preparation of national investment plans, the monitoring and control of investment execution, and the post-completion evaluation of projects. Special attention was given to reinforcing economic analysis capabilities at the public-sector level.
