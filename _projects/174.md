Following a review of possible ways for USAID and other donor agencies to support stock market development in low-income countries, this report applies three criteria to order preferences among the options. The criteria assume that each particular activity is worth doing, but consider the implications for broadly-based economic growth versus economic growth itself, the probability of change taking place even if USAID does not fund it, and the relative merits of IFC versus USAID assistance.The rest of the paper elaborates upon the concepts of investor protections and  creditorprotections, discussing their link to an economic concentration of financial assets and their importance in explaining stock market size. Countries offer different investor and creditor protections - often in response to their particular legal tradition - and the result is typically different evolutionary paths for financial markets. Analysis of the data shows that the presence of about half the possible investor protections is associated with larger stock market capitalizations, but that the presence of more protections than that is not associated with increases in capitalization.
