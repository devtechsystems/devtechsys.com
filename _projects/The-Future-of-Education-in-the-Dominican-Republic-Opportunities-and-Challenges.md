Brief Description: Instead of an evaluation of the PDE, the work was conducted as
  an analysis of the evolutionof the PDE to identify its achievements and strengths
  as well as its shortfalls and weaknessesand apply this experience in the design
  and implementation of future actions. The focus onthe PDE is a methodological recourse
  that allows a great deal of specificity in the analysis ofthe contributing factors
  and obstacles encountered in the implementation of the PDE and theformulation of
  implications and recommendations, thus avoiding generalities of little or novalue
  for future policy choices. In the end, however, we believe our contribution should
  notbe limited to an evaluation of the PDE as process. Thus, while we use an analysis
  of the PDEas a methodological recourse, and we do make certain “process” suggestions,
  we also makesome recommendations regarding the substantive nature of the reforms
  that are needed.In order to carry out a profound analysis of the roots of the educational
  problems that havebeen affecting the Dominican Republic for many years, we applied
  an eclectic methodologicalapproach that combines traditional empirical analysis
  with personal accounts of the mostimportant events and conditions. Without the latter
  element of investigation, albeit informal,we would fall into the trap of a superficial
  and perfunctory analysis, leaving some criticallyrelevant issues out of the picture
  simply because they could be controversial, a practice notacceptable in DevTech’s
  consulting ethics. Unfortunately, the history of public education inDominican Republic
  is plagued by decisions and activities that are not entirely transparent tothe general
  public and are conveniently omitted from the analysis of the pusillanimousinvestigator.
