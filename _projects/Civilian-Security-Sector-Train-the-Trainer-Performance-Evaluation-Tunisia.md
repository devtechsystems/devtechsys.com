Project Title: Civilian Security Sector Train-the-Trainer Performance Evaluation - Tunisia
Start Year: '2016'
End Year: '2018'
ISO3 Code:
  - TUN
Region: Africa
Country: Tunisia
Client/ Donor: U.S. Department of State
Brief Description: >-
  DevTech undertook a performance evaluation that focused on CT and INL
  assistance to Tunisian civilian law enforcement entities, including but not
  limited to the Brigade Antiterrorisme (BAT), the National Unit for the
  Investigation of Terrorist Crimes (UNECT), the Brigade d’Ordre Public (BOP)
  and BIMOP, the Brigade Nationale d’Intervention Rapide (BNIR), the Commandos,
  and the Counterterrorism Fusion Center. DevTech evaluation experts evaluated
  the results of CT and INL interventions, measuring for the success and
  effectiveness of TOT and other methodologies advanced by CT and INL. DevTech
  employed a mixed methods approach, deriving valuable data from a variety of
  data collection techniques, which will derive data from KIIs with a wide range
  of stakeholders and beneficiaries, to arranging FGDs and survey distribution.
  The DevTech evaluation was instrumental in informing future DoS-supported U.S.
  training and assistance to Tunisian civilian law enforcement, and in assisting
  evaluation end-users, decision makers from CT and INL bureaus, as well as the
  U.S. Embassy, to make actionable decisions that advance USG strategic
  objectives, including enhancing Tunisia’s civilian law enforcement entities to
  build investigative capacity regarding foreign terrorist fighters, as well as
  beneficiary capacity in the protection of soft targets from terrorist attacks.
