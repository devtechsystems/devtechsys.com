The Global Technology Network (GTN) contract expanded on DevTech's experience in developing and managing the environmental technology network for USAID/US-AEP. The primary objective of the GTN was to identify, disseminate information about, and match overseas business opportunities for, U.S. businesses interested in emerging markets. The GTN assisted lesser-developed countries (LDCs) countries graduating from USAID development assistance, and U.S. small and medium-size businesses to effectively respond to economic policy reforms and ensure sustainable economic growth through trade. DevTech's GTN staff provided assistance to companies operating in such industries as health, agri-business, financial services, telecommunications, and information technology.
