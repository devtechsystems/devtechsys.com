Following the January 2011 revolution in Egypt, the Ministry of Education launched a three-year nationwide project to restore stability and build the quality of the public education system.  They were supported by the USAID/Egypt Education Support Program (ESP). At the conclusion of the ESP, USAID/Egypt contracted DevTech and its subcontractor The QED Group, LLC (QED) to conduct the final performance evaluation of the program.

The evaluation objectives were:

* to review analyze, and evaluate the effectiveness of USAID-funded ESP activities in achieving program objectives and completing deliverables; and,
* to provide specific recommendations and lessons learned to ensure that future funding for capacity-building in the areas for Boards of Trustees (BOTs), teacher training, and remedial reading were directed to activities with the highest potential to achieve improved and sustainable results

To conduct this evaluation, the DevTech Team nominated a combination of home office staff and both American and Egyptian consultants with experience in evaluating higher education projects to effectively and efficiently carry out the evaluation.

DevTech has successfully managed and implemented more than 250 monitoring and evaluation activities in more than 90 countries across complicated socioeconomic contexts and non-permissive environments, including conflict and post-conflict areas.  Furthermore, the company has deep experience in promoting safe, inclusive, and effective learning environments by working with government leaders and international partners to broaden education and training opportunities for children, at-risk youth, and adults.
