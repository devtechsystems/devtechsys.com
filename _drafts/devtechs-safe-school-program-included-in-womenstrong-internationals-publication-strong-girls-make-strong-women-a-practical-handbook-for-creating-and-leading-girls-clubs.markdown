DevTech is proud to support WomenStrong International, an organization that grew out of the Millennium Cities Initiative. They focus on working with women and girls to end extreme urban poverty by funding, nurturing and sharing women-driven solutions. This International Women’s Day they have published their Strong Girls Make Strong Women: A Practical Handbook for Creating and Leading a Girls’ Club. This Handbook is a compendium of best practices to educate and empower girls from experts in the field. It is intended for educators, parents, community and religious leaders and mentors, governments, non-governmental organizations, scholars, funders, and peers working with girls and/or boys in their neighborhoods and communities.
The Handbook contains information from DevTech’s Safe School Program in Malawi. The Safe Schools Program is a pioneering, evidence-based initiative designed to reduce school-related gender-based violence (SRGBV), improve educational outcomes, and reduce negative health outcomes in Malawian schools. Safe Schools produced publications such as Doorways I: Student Training Manual, On School-Related Gender-Based Violence and Prevention and Response, now cited in WomenStrong International’s Handbook.
