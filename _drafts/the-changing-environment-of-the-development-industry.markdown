Last week, DevTech representatives – including Senior M&E Economist Dr. Oleksandr Rohozynsky; Senior Programming Advisor Tony Pryor; Business Development Associates Stephanie Bishop, Haykuhi Sekhposyan, and Nate Everett; M&E Associates and Program Managers Julia King, Ligia Perez, and Madeline Meis; and International Recruiter Pablo Paldao – attended the [Society for International Development (SID) Washington Chapter Annual Conference](https://sidw.org/2018-annual-conference). The company also sponsored the event.  

Our attendees enjoyed hearing the perspective from government representatives and industry colleagues on the panels about the changing environment of the development industry, particularly the need to adapt to these changes using innovative methods, models, and technology to more efficiently implement projects. They also got a chance to meet and talk to other industry representatives, consultants, and jobseekers at their table throughout the day.
