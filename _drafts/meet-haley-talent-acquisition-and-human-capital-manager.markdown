## What do you do? 
As Talent Acquisition and Human Capital Manager, I am responsible for managing human resources and domestic recruitment for the firm. This includes: training and development, compensation and benefits, employee relations, talent acquisition and retention, policy development, performance management, and compliance. 

## What are 5 things you do almost every day? 
My days vary drastically. Depending on the time of year, I can be working on a number of things in my day, usually much more than 5! This can include onboarding new employees, resolving employee grievances, managing recruitment, collaborating with senior management to develop HR strategies to meet business goals, preparing for and managing annual open enrollment, attending job fairs, reporting compliance to the federal government, and working with teams in the field to manage human resources for our international projects —just to name a few!

## Do you have a morning ritual? 
When I arrive in the office, I like to pour myself a cup of black tea. This gives me the pep I need to start my day!

## What kind of skills do you need to be effective in your role? 
Conflict management, discreetness, tactfulness, decision making, ethics, communication, knowledge of local and federal laws, and, above all, organization. Human Resources is somewhat of a balancing act.

## What is one word you would use to describe DevTech’s culture? 
DevTech has a strong team culture. Why? Employees at DevTech are encouraged to collaborate, share knowledge, communicate and support one another. Our employees’ happiness is one of DevTech’s top priorities. Our fun and nurturing culture allows employees to express themselves (decorating offices for holidays and throwing themed birthday parties, to name a few) and gives them the autonomy to complete their work the way they see fit. Additionally, we organize several company outings throughout the year, provide the flexibility to accommodate a realistic work-life balance, and hold annual potlucks. We know that employees who are happy in their jobs produce the best work.

## What do you like best about your job? 
There are lots of different facets to HR. I enjoy being able to work on multiple things in one day. Quite often, the day I have planned when I come into the office is very different than the day I have completed when I leave. I enjoy the ambiguity and “surprise” factor that HR brings. There is never a dull day. 

## What advice would you give to someone looking to become a HR Manager? 
I would tell someone looking to become a HR Manager to stay organized. Most of the items a Human Resources professional works with everyday are of great importance and have their place. Keeping things organized, so they can be found when needed, is important. Being organized also helps when there are a lot of things to manage at once. Multitasking is especially important in a human resources position and staying organized will ensure success.
