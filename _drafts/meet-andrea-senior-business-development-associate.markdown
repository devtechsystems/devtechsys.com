**What do you do?**

As a Senior Business Development Associate I wear several hats. 
* Client relations: Being behind the desk is just as important as being at the table. I keep up with our clients’ updates through meetings, events, and conferences.
* Proposal development:  We are usually given one month to develop and submit a proposal to USAID or DOS. This takes coordination between partner firms, technical writers, local firms, and the cost team. 
* Updating our BD pipelines: We need to be ready for any proposal vital for company success. When creating our BD pipeline we are managing our business partners, staff, and technical approach, while conducting research to prepare our team for when the solicitation is released.   

**What are 5 things you do almost every day?**

Read at least one article related to my job, review our BD pipeline, check in with the team, clean-up my inbox, and update my to-do list at the end of the day. 

**Do you have a morning ritual? Something you do to start your day?**

Drink coffee and touch base with the BD team.  There is nothing worse than starting your day with an empty cup or no connection with your team.  

**What kind of skills do you need to be effective in your role?**

Several skills come to mind:  Be well organized, task oriented, and prompt, but, most importantly, be able to communicate to others the vision for each proposal. 

**What is one word you would use to describe DevTech’s culture? Why?**

Inclusive. With DevTech’s global reach, the company does a great job at being conscious of the importance of how our diverse backgrounds and perspectives empower employees to vocalize our opinions for all to gain from the collective’s interest in creating value.  
 
**What do you like best about your job?**

My teammates. While our team is small, we accomplish a lot – especially under pressure! This is due to our mutual respect, encouragement, and dependence on each other. It is rewarding to work with a group of people who genuinely care about your well being and are willing to step in and support other team members when needed.  

**What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Senior Business Development Associate?**

In business development, we are constantly working under tight deadlines, juggling multiple proposals, and reviewing contracts, all the while ensuring our proposals are top quality. To do this job well you must be flexible and adaptable and able to take rejection when we don’t win a contract (it comes with the territory).
