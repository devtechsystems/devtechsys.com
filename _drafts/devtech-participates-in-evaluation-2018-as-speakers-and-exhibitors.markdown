We will be participating in the 32nd Annual American Evaluation Association conference, [Evaluation 2018](https://www.evaluationconference.org/p/cm/ld/fid=619), in Cleveland, Ohio, from October 21 through November 3, 2018.  DevTech Director of Monitoring and Evaluation, Dr. Reuben Hermoso, will be presenting a roundtable session on November 3rd with Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Associate, Julia P. King, on the subject, [“East Africa Collective Impact Evaluation of Countering Violent Extremism Programs.”](https://www.evaluationconference.org/p/cm/ld/fid=610)The conversation will focus on the quasi-experimental impact evaluation (IE) which the Department of State’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) is conducting, in partnership with DevTech, and how this IE will be used to help understand the impact of Countering Violent Extremism  (CVE) programming on strengthening and securing communities.

Within the field of conflict, security, and development, the impact of CVE programming is not well understood. Although the use of rigorous data collection methods to measure the impact of single interventions is increasing, it is still extremely rare to measure the strategic effects of a group of CVE interventions in a specific country or region. DevTech has designed an IE to measure the overall impact of 18 CVE programs in Kenya and Tanzania under the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund (CTPF). The evaluation assesses regional progress against identified CVE indicators that measure communities’ risk for or resilience to violent extremist (VE) activity and recruiting, including measures of socio-economic inequality, religious and ethnic conflict, good governance, political freedom and participation, and social cohesion. This evaluation focuses on both determining the overall strategic-level impact of the cumulative CTPF activities on the above indicators and identifying recommendations for future CVE programming in the region.

Dr. Hermoso and Ms. King will share their experiences of conducting this CVE impact evaluation, as well as lessons learned.

DevTech will also be exhibiting at booth #6 on November 1st and 2nd.  Please stop by to say hello and learn more about our evaluation projects.
