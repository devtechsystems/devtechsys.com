DevTech’s Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) practice is currently supporting two projects in Nigeria:
* USAID/Nigeria Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Activity:  The MEL Activity’s goal is to transform USAID/Nigeria into a premier practitioner of program M&E rooted in a learning and adaptive culture.  DevTech provides on-the-ground and on-demand M&E support to technical teams and implementing partners. Learn more: https://devtechsys.com/projects/Nigeria-Monitoring-Evaluation/
* •	* USAID/Nigeria Support for Strategic Information and Project Management Serivces (S4SIPMS): DevTech was awarded the S4SIPMS Project in support of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) efforts to save the lives and improve the health status of people living with HIV. S4SIPMS conducts Site Improvement through Monitoring Systems (SIMS) assessments to continuously monitor and assess sites receiving PEPFAR funding, and to ensure effective, quality program implementation and adherence to national and international standards and accountability. The project is responsible for planning and conducting SIMS assessments, capacity building data literacy, and synthesizing and analyzing evaluation lessons to determine policy implications. The project consistently exceeds its targets for SIMS assessments, completing 108% of its goal in FY2017 and 115% in FY2018. DevTech successfully works in conflict zones in Nigeria and is the only contractor with the existing, on-the-ground capability to do so on behalf of the USG.
