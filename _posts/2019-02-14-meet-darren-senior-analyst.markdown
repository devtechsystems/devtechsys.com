## What do you do?

I am a Senior Analyst on the USAID Data Services Team (ADVISE) and a member of the Foreign Assistance team. The team is responsible for fulfilling USAID’s reporting responsibility of US foreign assistance spending to the Congress and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and reporting USAID’s spending to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI).  

## What are 5 things you do almost every day?

Every task I have is collaborative in some sense, so I’m communicating with people, both colleagues and clients, on a daily basis. I write or update some sort of program almost every day. I’m always working on multiple tasks, so I keep my tasks list updated and organized as much as possible. I do my best to monitor various forums to stay up to date on discussions and news from OECD, IATI, etc.  

## Do you have a morning ritual? Something you do to start your day?

When I first get in, I scan through the emails and newsletters sent by USAID. Yes, they are dry, but they often have useful bits of information.

## What kind of skills do you need to be effective in your role?

Much of my job can be thought of as problem solving. We often have to find creative solutions to fulfill requests or complete tasks.  This might be finding the best way to estimate aid spending in particular sector or how to most efficiently use computer resources when processing large datasets. I also find that being able to efficiently switch between tasks is very important. I’m usually completing multiple tasks concurrently, or have to stop one task to complete a more urgent one. 

## What is one word you would use to describe DevTech’s culture? Why?

Collegial. Within the Foreign Assistance team and the wider US Data Services Team I have found that people are always willing to help and take on tasks.  

## What do you like best about your job?

I’ve really enjoyed collaborating with colleagues outside of USAID in various development agencies and CSOs. Interacting with colleagues from around the world has given me a better understanding of the wider development community and USAID’s place within in it.  This collaboration has also given me a chance to travel, which I’ve really enjoyed.  

## What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Senior Analyst?

Learn the type of skills that transfer across any subject area. Subject matter expertise is important, but skills in analytical techniques and software are more broadly applicable and useful.
