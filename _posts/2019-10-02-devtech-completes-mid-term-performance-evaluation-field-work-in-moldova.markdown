DevTech’s evaluation team has just finished a month of field work in Moldova for a mid-term performance evaluation of the USAID-funded Moldova Competitiveness Project. Over the four-week period, our team of six international and five local experts conducted key informant interviews, focus groups, and site visits to evaluate the MCP. Our experts visited SMEs in four distinct industries: wine, tourism, light manufacturing, and information and communication technologies. The team worked across the country to observe these business’ production facilities and assess the impact of the USAID project on livelihoods. This first-hand observation of Moldova's journey to self-reliance will be followed by thorough analysis of the data of these four industries to see how successful the MCP has been in developing and promoting them. The field work and analysis will result in an evaluation report and sector assessments containing recommendations for USAID on how to improve the project’s effectiveness in supporting the targeted industries in Moldova. With this report, DevTech hopes to help inform the work of USAID/Moldova as it develops its new CDCS.
