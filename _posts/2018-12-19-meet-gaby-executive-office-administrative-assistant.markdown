## What do you do? 
As the Executive Office Administrative Assistant, I manage the CEO’s calendar and requests for meetings, welcome guests when they arrive, set up new employees with IT equipment and entry badges, and ensure office and kitchen supplies are adequate. I am also the point of contact for building communication and service requests, organize office-wide social events, and provide admin support to project managers as needed.

## What are 5 things you do almost every day?
My job is not predictable, so tasks can vary day to day. Usually, I check my email in the morning and do my best to prioritize the requests coming my way. I look religiously at my notes and Outlook tasks from the day before to make sure I am not missing important work. Another thing I do every day is to make sure there is enough coffee for our staff (I’m a coffee drinker too!) and ensure the reception area is ready to welcome guests. 

## Do you have a morning ritual? Something you do to start your day?
In the morning, while the office is still quiet, I like to drink my coffee while checking emails. 

## What kind of skills do you need to be effective in your role?
I think to be successful at any job or in life you need to be organized, flexible – because things never go according to plan – and, most importantly, have a good attitude. Come to work to give your best! 

## What is one word you would use to describe DevTech’s culture? Why?
Teamwork. Because no matter what position an individual holds in the company, he or she is always willing to work with staff from different areas of expertise to get positive results.

## What do you like best about your job?
I like that every day is different and that I work in an environment that values diversity. I also enjoy working for our CEO, Rafael, because he is passionate about DevTech and takes the time to develop positive relationships with his staff.   

## What advice would you give to someone looking to become an Executive Office Administrative Assistant?
I would suggest that you learn as much as you can about your job responsibilities, the key people you work with, and time management. Also, multitasking is a big part of this job and you must be able to prioritize and be flexible enough to handle last-minute requests.
