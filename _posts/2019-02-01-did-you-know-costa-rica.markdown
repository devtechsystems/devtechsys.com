Did you know that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) gave $4.696 million of foreign aid to Costa Rica in 2017 (2018 is not yet fully reported)?  This represents 26% of the total $18 million donated by all US agencies combined, $ 1.3 million of USAIDâ€™s funding went to the education sector.
