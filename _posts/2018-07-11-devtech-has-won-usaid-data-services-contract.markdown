DevTech Systems is pleased to announce it has won the USAID Data Services contract.  The project, currently known as ADVISE (to be renamed USAID Data Services in 2018), is a follow-on to the Economic Analysis and Data Services (EADS) contract DevTech held from 2007-2018. ADVISE – Analytics, Data, Visualization, and Information Services – merges under one contract four current projects under USAID’s Management Bureau, Chief Information Officer: EADS, USAID’s library (including the Development Experience Clearinghouse – DEC), The Development Data Library (DDL), and the Enterprise Reporting Portal. In addition, ADVISE will work on implementing data governance procedures and standards for the Agency and on unifying database systems and portals.

The award of this five-year project is a result of DevTech’s strong performance under EADS and a recognition of its qualifications in data management and analysis. 

“We are pleased to be able to continue to support the valuable work USAID’s Management Bureau does in supporting publicly available data via visual and interactive tools,” commented Rafael Romeu, President and CEO of DevTech. “We firmly believe that quality data well managed and well visualized enables decision-makers to shape strategic direction and implement projects more efficiently and effectively.”

As an example of an early success for this project, ADVISE launched the Women’s Economic Empowerment and Equality (WE3) Dashboard in April. This is a joint effort with USAID’s Office of Gender Equality & Women’s Empowerment (USAID/E3/GenDev) and a long-term project of ex-EADS staff now made available under ADVISE. It is a visual and interactive tool that is used to explore data related to women’s economic, social, and political inclusion. It allows users to assess the extent to which women participate in their respective economies, and compare the selected economy to regional, income group, and global averages. The WE3 Dashboard is publicly available at [https://idea.usaid.gov/women-e3](https://idea.usaid.gov/women-e3).
