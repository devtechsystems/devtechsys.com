DevTech recently attended the American Evaluation Association 32nd Annual Conference, hosted this year in Cleveland, Ohio, as an exhibitor and presenter. The conference brought together a large network of evaluators from across the country and the world to share research findings and best practices in evaluation and to come together as an evaluation community to discuss how we can better *Speak Truth to Power* – the theme of this year’s conference. As evaluators, we are tasked with obtaining and presenting evidence-based findings to identify areas of success or failure within a given context or project. The conference was focused around thinking critically about the theme of *Speaking Truth to Power*: What is power and influence in today’s world? Do we, as evaluators, have power and influence? What is truth? How can we best identify truths? What defines “speaking” and how can we best make our voices heard in speaking truth to diverse audiences?

DevTech’s Monitoring & Evaluation Practice Director, Dr. Reuben Hermoso, and Senior Monitoring & Evaluation Associate, Julia King, presented findings from DevTech’s Department of State-funded project, Measuring the Overall Impact of East Africa Countering Violent Extremism (CVE), to the AEA Conference community on Saturday morning November 3rd. They shared the project’s methodology, initial findings from data collection activities (both quantitative and qualitative), as well as lessons learned. Their presentation stimulated an engaging discussion with attendees on methods, challenges, and the future of this evaluation work in East Africa.
