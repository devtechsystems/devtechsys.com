Representatives from DevTech will be presenting and attending the International Consortium on Governmental Financial Management (ICGFM) [2018 Winter Training Conference](https://www.icgfm.org/programs/conferences-training/current-conference-information/) to be held December 3-5, 2018 at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, DC. ICGFM, as the only worldwide grouping of organizations and people involved in governmental financial management, encourages its members to work together to promote a better understanding of professional financial management among public officials at all levels of government. The theme for this year’s conference is “PFM in a Changing World.”

DevTech’s CEO, Rafael Romeu, who spoke at the conference last year, will also be attending.  We hope to see you there!
