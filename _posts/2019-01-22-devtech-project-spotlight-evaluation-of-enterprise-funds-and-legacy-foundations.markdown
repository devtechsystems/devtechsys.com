In 2016, DevTech conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the Enterprise Funds and Legacy Foundations to provide USAID, other Fund and Foundation stakeholders, and the American public with an account of the experiences, successes and accomplishments, and shortcomings of the Funds and Foundations. 

The evaluation team visited multiple countries, including Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine. Furthermore, the team met with current and former Fund and Foundation staff to verify their initial findings, as well as various Enterprise Funds investees and Legacy Foundation grantees. The team used a combination of approaches and tools that varied by country, including:
* Key informant interviews (KIIs)
* Focus group discussions (FGDs)
* Anonymous electronic surveys (using Google Forms)
* Document review

The evaluation team successfully condensed challenges, successes, and recommendations for 10 Funds and nine Foundations into a single, cohesive report, and worked closely with the Bureau for Europe and Eurasia to finalize a product for several USAID Missions and Fund and Foundation stakeholders. The full report can be accessed here: [https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00STKC.pdf](https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00STKC.pdf) 

DevTech has successfully managed and implemented more than 250 monitoring and evaluation activities in more than 90 countries across complicated socioeconomic contexts and non-permissive environments, including conflict and post-conflict areas. Our breadth of experience includes conducting multi-country and multi-sector evaluations including baseline, mid-term, and final evaluation data collection, performance evaluations, experimental and quasi-experimental impact evaluations, results frameworks, evaluation technical assistance, and training. All of our work is grounded in sound quantitative and qualitative research methods.
