On August 6, DevTech’s USAID Data Services program presented the [Women’s Economic Empowerment and Equality (WE3) Dashboard](https://idea.usaid.gov/women-e3) to the USAID Gender Champions. The Gender Champions group is comprised of gender experts from multiple bureaus and offices across the Agency, and at least four USAID bureaus were represented at the WE3 presentation. The WE3 Dashboard is a visual and interactive tool that it is used to explore data related to women’s economic, social, and political inclusion. The WE3 Dashboard allows users to assess the extent to which women participate in their respective economies, and to compare the economy to regional, income group, and global averages. The Dashboard was released in April 2018 as a joint effort between USAID’s Office of Gender Equality & Women’s Empowerment (USAID/E3/GenDev) and Data Services.

The tool is housed on the International Data and Economic Analysis ([IDEA](https://idea.usaid.gov/)) website, a repository of over 10,000 data series from over 100 sources. 

The WE3 Dashboard focuses on five priority or pillar areas: 
1. Access to Capital
1. Access to Markets
1. Innovation and Technology
1. Leadership, Voice, and Agency
1. Skills, Capacity-Building, and Health

The Dashboard was presented by Ryan Whalen (Senior Economist) and Deanna Snellings (Data Analyst). Whalen and Snellings presented the background and origins of the dashboard, the methodology behind the dashboard’s structure and composite scoring, and gave a demonstration of Kazakhstan’s dashboard. Additionally, Snellings introduced the WE3 [Snapshot](https://idea.usaid.gov/prepared/Snapshots/eads_snapshot_107.pdf), an IDEA analytical product that gives a high-level global analysis of the data in the dashboard. Following the presentation, the team facilitated requests for more presentations from USAID bureaus in the future, so there will be more to come!
