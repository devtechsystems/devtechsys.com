DevTech will be promoting its USAID/Data Services products and interacting with other data industry professionals at the upcoming Data Day and Fair on February 13 from 9:30 – 5:30 at World Bank headquarters in Washington, DC.

The purpose of Data Day is to bring World Bank teams working on key development data issues and projects together with key partners and global experts. Together, they will look at what’s working, what’s not, and what’s coming to encourage better understanding and support lasting social and economic development across contexts.  

We look forward to seeing you next Wednesday!
