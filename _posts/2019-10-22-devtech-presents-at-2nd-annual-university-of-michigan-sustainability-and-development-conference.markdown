DevTech was proud to present its work at the 2nd Annual University of Michigan Sustainability and Development Conference, which took place in Ann Arbor on October 10 – 14, 2019. Dr. Reuben Hermoso and Marisa Acierno of DevTech’s Monitoring and Evaluation practice were accepted to present the impact evaluation of East African countering violent extremism (CVE) programming that DevTech is conducting for the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Conflict Stabilization Operations (CSO). As one of the few contractors in a room of academics, our staff brought practical approaches and field-tested methodologies to the discussion on how practitioners can better understand and address violence in development. DevTech will conduct the final round of the evaluation early next year and has already received an expression of interest from the Journal of Leadership, Accountability and Ethics (JLAE) to review our findings for possible publication.
