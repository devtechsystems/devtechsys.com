<p>DevTech is launching projects in the Energy and Environment spheres, beginning this year with a multi-year Amazonian biodiversity strengthening program in Brazil.   Our team of experts provides technical training in monitoring and evaluation as well as communications and outreach support for local biodiversity conservation organizations, thereby supporting conservation by strengthening the institutions and communities already working to protect the region.  Through our capacity building services, DevTech supports the overarching USAID Brazil Mission Partnership for the Conservation of Amazon Biodiversity (PCAB) in its ongoing efforts to improve conservation efforts in priority protected areas and to implement innovative practices that support environmental management in indigenous lands.</p>
