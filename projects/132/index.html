				    <p>Under EISN, DevTech provided support to the Environment and Natural Resources (ENR) Division of the Bureau for Europe and Eurasia. The support ranged from assisting with management of Regulation 216 compliance to supporting EcoLinks (an environmental trade program). The EISN Project gave DevTech the opportunity to implement several different activities. Examples of these include:Biodiversity Assessments—DevTech provided technical expertise to the USAID Missions in Bulgaria and Serbia/Montenegro to develop strategic biodiversity assessments in conjunction with their five-year strategies. Country needs were identified and analyzed to provide concrete recommendations for strengthening the Missions’ environmental portfolios.Technical Review of Biodiversity Assessments—DevTech performed a technical review and evaluation of the results of five assessments from the Central Asia Region conducted by another firm to ensure the thoroughness and accuracy of the environmental information and usefulness of the recommendations. During the review, DevTech identified several areas in the assessments where the Missions could introduce environmental themes into ongoing projects to help them be more cross-cutting.Assessment of Priority Issues Regarding Environmental Impacts of Land Privatization in Eastern Europe and Eurasia—A DevTech team of in-country and US-based specialists conducted an assessment of environmental impacts of land privatization activities in 15 transition countries in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. The field study, commissioned by the Environment and Natural Resources (ENR) Division of the Bureau for Europe and Eurasia, identified environmental impacts, both positive and negative, of land privatization in the region, and outlined priority focal points for USAID during the ongoing land privatization process. The work was completed under tight deadlines within a two-month time frame.Report on Progress Made Toward Meeting the E&amp;E Bureau Strategic Objective for Environment—The assessment of progress made toward achieving development goals is essential for the efficient design of environmental assistance programs. DevTech specialists took stock of developments in transition countries in Eastern Europe and Eurasia and evaluated the environmental performance of beneficiary countries in 1999, 2000, and 2001. The analysis available in the Transition Report was used to evaluate the effectiveness of assistance programs in the region. ENR Division staff have used the information in these reports to provide briefing information to senior management at USAID. The reports also were used as an indicator of which countries were progressing sufficiently to allow a decrease in environmental program support.Analysis of Water and Wastewater Treatment Technologies Applicable to Eastern Europe—DevTech surveyed promising water and wastewater treatment technologies and prepared an analysis of their suitability in the E&amp;E region. The firm conducted an extensive web search and surveyed more than 20 companies to determine which new technologies might be easily adapted in the region. The output of the report was provided to EcoLinks management to help it with strategy development during the following year.Technical Review of a Risk Assessment Methodology – DevTech reviewed a report intended for use as a risk assessment methodology primer. USAID used the review to require the report provide more focus on the methodology of risk assessment.Caspian Environmental Regulatory Partnership Program Workshop on Air Emission Regulation Development—DevTech provided expert technical assistance in implementing this workshop on air emissions and allowing for oil exploration in Kazakhstan. As part of facilitating the program, DevTech staff moderated the US-Kazakh workshop on implementing air pollution control permits. The meeting ended with general agreement that the working group approach to developing realistic regulatory reform had the potential to be effective.</p>
