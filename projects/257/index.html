				    <p>In 2003, the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) signed a cooperative agreement with DevTech to implement the Combating Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic project. The program works worked with the International Labor Organization, the Dominican Secretariats of Education and Labor, and other stakeholders to:Raise awareness of the importance of education for all children and to mobilize a wide array of actors to improve and expand education infrastructures;Strengthen formal and transitional education systems that encourage working children and those at risk of working to attend school;Strengthen national institutions and policies on education and child labor; andEnsure the long-term sustainability of these efforts.The Dominican Republic’s Secretariat of Labor defined the "worst forms of child labor" (WFCL) as hazardous work in agriculture, dangerous urban work in streets or sweatshops, domestic servants, child trafficking, and commercial sexual exploitation. When the Dominican Government ratified ILO Convention 182, it committed to take immediate and effective measures to eliminate the WFCL within 10 years. Within this framework, as well as the USDOL’s objectives, this project’s goal was to reduce the number of children involved in WFCL by 4,200—commercial sexual exploitation (450), informal urban economy (850), and dangerous agriculture (2,900)—over a four-year period. Targeted children included those who either dropped out of school or attended school irregularly, with the latter group repeating grades or ropping out of school altogether. About 5,600 children benefitted from this program.Project InterventionsThe Combating Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic project addressed three main areas: creating a complete educational program for "the other shift," or the other half-day; making school more relevant and attractive by providing teachers and administrators with special training and supervision; and providing vocational education to adolescents who opted out of regular schooling.Espacios Para Crecer ("Spaces for Growth")DevTech and its partners developed an education program to ensure regular school attendance bychildren in the 6-14 age group (the targed age range for the project). The project team created Espacios para Crecer (Spaces for Growth) – a high-quality, well-structured program with three basic components: academic leveling (focusing on math, reading, and writing), recreation (physical education, music, theater, art, and literature), and life skills.Attendance records indicated that over 95 percent of the targeted children attended both regular school and the Espacios para Crecer program daily, and were promoted both during and at the end of the school year. Teacher TrainingThe project also focused on the teachers of the targeted children. A three-day training course in Quantum Learning methodology was delivered to 500 educators and administrators.After the first training course to 160 educators (financed with project funds), the Dominican Secretariat of Education was so impressed that it financed courses for 240 teachers and administrators, while Plan International, an NGO, financed courses for 100 more teachers.Vocational EducationThe vocational training program targeting adolescents (14–17 years old) presented challenges since vocational education institutions in the Dominican Republic require a basic education (8th grade) certificate for admission and very few of the targeted adolescents had completed 8th grade.The project team identified several institutions that were willing to offer programs to these adolescents. For example, a private institution in Santiago trained 33 adolescents in pastry making, commercial sewing (tailoring), and basic computer skills. A private vocational school in Santo Domingo offered a special program for 80 adolescents during a six-week summer session. One rural school with a small computer lab provided computer skills training for adolescents in that community. In the beach community of Sosúa, 30 young women completed a six-month training course for beauty salon assistants. The project also adapted a program for micro-enterprise training that was taught to a group of adolescents and their parents in the beach community of Las Terrenas.SustainabilityTo ensure the sustainability of the program, DevTech and its partners created a consortium to continue the operation of existing EpCs and advance improvements in education. The consortium has become a strong network of Dominican and U.S.-based organizations and has received support from multiple sources, including the Dominican Secretariat of Education, among others.Also, the EpC program has been replicated by DevTech and other organizations in communities in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Colombia.In 2007, the EpC program and the activities of DevTech and its partners received additional funding (through 2011) from the U.S. Department of Labor.
