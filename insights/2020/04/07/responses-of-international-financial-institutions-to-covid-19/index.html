          <p>“The success and pace of recovery will depend crucially on policies undertaken during the crisis. If policies ensure that workers do not lose their jobs, renters and homeowners are not evicted, companies avoid bankruptcy, and business and trade networks are preserved, the recovery will occur sooner and more smoothly”</p>

<p>Dell’Ariccia et al. (2020)</p>

<p>The COVID-19 is presenting unprecedented challenges for the economy. The (well-deserved) stringent measures that are being taken to slow down the spread of the disease are putting entire sectors of the economy in distress. Fortunately, it is likely that the COVID-19 disruption will be temporary. Unfortunately, large sectors of the population are losing their income sources at a fast pace, and business are experiencing enormous financial distress as their revenues are halted.</p>

<p>Governments around the world are taking measures to shield the economy during the contingency. Some measures include subsidizing salaries of closed business, providing (un)employment benefits, and subsidizing loans or providing grants so business can stay afloat. Those who live paycheck to paycheck, require immediate support to fulfill their basic needs. Business also require support, as a job that is lost due to a business going bankrupt will not be recovered after the epidemic has ended.</p>

<p>The crisis affects government finances two-fold. Their expenditure requirements increase to provide the aforementioned measures, meanwhile their tax revenues are significantly decrease as the economic activity decreases. There is a large need for government funding, but financing alternatives are scarce.</p>

<p>International Financial Institutions are rapidly taking measures to inject liquidity into the public and private sectors of countries in distress. We provide below a list of measures and programs that are being undertaken by several International Financial Institutions.</p>

<p><strong>The World Bank (WB)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The World Bank will provide up to $160 billion in support to client countries over the next 15 months.</li>
  <li>One component will be $6 billion for expedited loan guarantees from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This will enable the purchase of urgent medical equipment and provide working capital for companies, including smaller businesses, while also supporting governments’ short-term funding needs.</li>
  <li>Special provisions for fast-track financing are allowing an initial group of World Bank projects totaling $1.9 billion to get underway quickly in 25 countries. Bank teams are also working with clients to rapidly redeploy a further $1.7 billion from existing projects to urgent pandemic response and recovery.</li>
  <li>Emergency financing includes $8 billion from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), where work is underway to help the private sector cope with the pandemic.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>International Monetary Fund (IMF)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Provision of Emergency Financing through the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) and Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI).</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>RCF provides financial assistance to low income countries facing an urgent balance of payments need without ex-post conditionality. Limited to 50 percent of quota per year and 100 percent on cumulative basis. This amount could go up if the damage caused by a natural disaster exceeds 20% of GDP. This loan has zero interest-rate, a grace period of 5.5 years, and a maturity of 10 years. There is $10 billion available for RCF.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
