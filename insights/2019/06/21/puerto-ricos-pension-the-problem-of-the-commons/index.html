          <p>In June 2016, Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), establishing a bankruptcy-like restructuring framework to address Puerto Ricoâs government debt crisis and a Financial Oversight and Management Board (FOMB) to oversee the process.  Puerto Rico defaulted on its debt the same year and the FOMB filed for Title III protection under PROMESA for the Commonwealth and several instrumentalities in 2017.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/PR%201.jpg" alt="PR 1.jpg" /></p>

<p>On June 16, 2019, the FOMB announced that it had reached a Plan Support Agreement with certain groups of bondholders to support a plan of adjustment for the Commonwealthâs debt (1). The FOMBâs proposed terms would resolve $35 billion of claims against the Commonwealth and involve an average haircut of more than 60%.  The FOMB has announced that it plans to file its plan of adjustment for the Commonwealth in the next month and hopes that the Commonwealth will emerge from Title III as soon as early 2020.</p>

<p>Despite the agreement between the FOMB and certain creditor groups, the Government of Puerto Rico does not support the proposed plan of adjustment, which includes cuts to retireesâ pensions.  The position of the RossellÃ³ administration has been to categorically oppose any cut to pension benefits, which the Government maintains are unacceptable. The Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority (AAFAF, by its Spanish acronym) released a statement in response to the FOMBâs Agreement making clear that the Government declined to be a party to the Agreement, does not support it, and will not take any legislative, executive, or administrative action to implement any Plan of Adjustment that cuts pension benefits (2).</p>

<p>The Governmentâs reluctance to accept any pension cuts is understandable: RossellÃ³ administration has been placed in the difficult position of needing to defund Puerto Ricansâ pensions due to the consequences of decades of fiscal mismanagement by prior administrations.  The current administration did not create the crisis, but is nevertheless responsible of navigating the largest municipal restructuring in US history while protecting and defending its citizens.  The Government is right to consider the needs of its residents. Not only is this its fundamental responsibility, but the success of the restructuring depends on it. Municipal restructuring is vulnerable to a problem that is less often seen in sovereign restructurings: the risk that residents will choose to leave.  While there are legal barriers to emigration, residents can more freely choose to leave a territory or municipality that is not economically viable.   Any Puerto Rican has the right to board a short plane flight to the mainland United States, which is currently enjoying a ten-year economic expansion and very low unemployment, and thousands of Puerto Ricans have done exactly that over the past decade. A declining population exacerbates the Governmentâs problem.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, categorical opposition to pension cuts presents an obstacle to any restructuring agreement.  Puerto Ricoâs public pension systems are bankrupt: after years of shortfalls in government employersâ pension contributions, the system is severely underfunded and there is no easy solution. The pensions are currently funded as a pay-as-you-go basis, but this does not sufficiently address the shortfall.  Pension costs are very easy to underfund: governments tend persistently understate their pension liabilities and overestimate returns using improper actuarial assumptions, and the shortfalls accrue with little oversight at the local, state and Federal level.</p>

<p>Unfunded pension liabilities account for a significant proportion of the debt of state and local governments â the FOMB claims their proposal restructures over $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. The true cost of pensions may not be obvious but is critical to address.  There are few options for addressing a pension shortfall. Other jurisdictions facing similar crises have also been forced to cut public pensions, most notably Detroit, and the RossellÃ³ administration and Puerto Rican retirees have successfully pushed back against the FOMBâs proposed pension cuts: the current proposal includes fewer reductions than the FOMB initially proposed, and the retiree committee has offered its support.  Whatever mechanisms or entities allegedly exist in the United States to surveil municipal bond markets and municipal pensions, the prima facia evidence of emerging nation-wide pension and municipal finance pressures suggests their work is not on par with the massive efforts that go into surveilling equity and corporate bond markets. Moreover, the legal resolution presented here seems to leave municipal workers with the responsibility of carrying out due diligence on their employersâ present and future willingness and ability to appropriately fund their pensions (and possibly avoid bankruptcy altogether). The Government of Puerto Ricoâs continued opposition to any pension benefit reduction is completely politically understandable, and reflects its forced reckoning with the fiscal consequences of a pension system suffering from decades of underfunding and more generally the âproblem of the commonsâ of municipal pension funding that continues to be largely ignored by market regulators.</p>
