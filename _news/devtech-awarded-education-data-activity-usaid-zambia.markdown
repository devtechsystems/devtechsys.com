DevTech has recently been awarded the Education Data Activity (USAID/Zambia), which will provide assessment, data management, and research services to monitor and evaluate USAID’s upcoming Let’s Read Zambia activity. The Education Data Activity will complete a baseline and a midline EGRA assessment to measure the impact of Let’s Read Zambia on the ability of learners to read at grade level by the end of Grade 2. This activity is managed in close collaboration with USAID/Zambia, the Ministry of General Education (MOGE), the Examination Council of Zambia (ECZ), and other key stakeholders, and will continue to strengthen the capacity of the ECZ to track and collect data to improve learning outcomes. A new DevTech project office in Lusaka, Zambia is coming soon.
