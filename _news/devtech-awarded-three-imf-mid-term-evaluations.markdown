DevTech was awarded the International Monetary Fund (IMF) External Evaluation Services Provider contract for the External Mid-Term Evaluation of three capacity development subaccounts: the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC), the Middle East Regional Technical Assistance Center (METAC), and the Switzerland Technical Assistance Sub-Account (SECO). 

Under each subaccount, the DevTech team will engage in a multi-phase evaluation process to assess whether CARTAC, METAC, and SECO are achieving their set objectives, if the current Capacity Development activities are addressing the specific needs of member countries, whether they are operating at a optimal scale, and evaluating how the results of the last evaluation have been implemented. Our Team will be traveling extensively throughout the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Middle East to execute field research and more deeply analyze the successes, challenges, and gaps the Regional Technical Assistance Centers and SECO are facing. A few countries on the list are Jamaica, Colombia, Egypt, and Lebanon.‚Äù
