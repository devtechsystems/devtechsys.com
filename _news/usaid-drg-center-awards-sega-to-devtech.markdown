DevTech Systems, Inc. was awarded by USAID’s Democracy, Human Rights and Governance (DRG) Center the **Swift Expertise and Grounded Analytics (SEGA)** Task Order to provide the Center, USAID regional bureaus, and USAID field missions with a mechanism to rapidly assess needs and opportunities in the context of a democratic transition, and to implement short-term advisory services where they are needed most in response to an unforeseen political transition.

For this five-year task order under the [Analytical Services IV IDIQ](https://devtechsys.com/projects/Analytical-Services-IV/), DevTech anticipates providing technical assistance primarily in three USAID regions (Africa, Asia, and Europe/Eurasia) leveraging the success and expertise of its consortium to rapidly and effectively deploy data gathering teams for both remote survey data collection and qualitative interviews in ongoing COVID-affected projects.
