DevTech Systems won the Fiscal Accountability and Sustainable Trade (FAST) task order under the Public Financial Management II (PFM II) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ). The five-year project supports the Bureau for Economic Growth, Education, and Environmentâ€™s offices of Economic Policy (E3/EP) and Trade and Regulatory Reform (E3/TRR) in providing rapid and on-demand technical assistance to USAID missions. 

DevTech is tasked with supporting rapid, sustainable, and equitable economic growth in USAID-assisted countries by enabling USAID to bring a systems approach to addressing PFM, trade capacity building, macroeconomic planning and policies, and other economic governance issues. FAST will support missions to improve the following: host-country capacity to mobilize revenue and provide public services; policy climates for investment that generate more productive employment and inclusive growth; host-country ability to recover from, prevent, and/or mitigate the impact of conflict, natural disasters, or fiscal crises; and host-country institutional capacity to identify, design, advocate, and implement better economic policies to enhance inclusive growth and gender equity.
