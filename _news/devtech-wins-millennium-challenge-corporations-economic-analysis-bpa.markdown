The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has awarded DevTech a five-year blanket purchase agreement (BPA) in support of the Economic Analysis Division in the Department of Policy and Evaluation (DPE) to conduct routine economic analysis of past, ongoing, and future projects across Compact and Threshold programs. DevTech has previously worked with MCC/DPE, having held the BPA for Threshold Monitoring and Evaluation Support and Social and Gender Support from 2015 to 2018. 
 
Under this new BPA, DevTech and its implementing partners—The Economist, RAND Corporation, Abt Associates, the Dalberg Group, and Resources for the Future—will be required to perform analytic work across several sectors including health, education, water and sanitation, agriculture and irrigation, energy and electricity, transport, digital infrastructure and economy, and financial services. In addition, the team's experts will assist MCC economic staff on various cross-cutting topics, such as policy and institutional reform, climate change and environmental economic modeling, gender and inclusion, public finance management, and blended finance instruments and their applications.
