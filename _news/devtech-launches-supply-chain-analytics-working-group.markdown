**DevTech is excited to announce the creation of the Supply Chain Analytics Working Group!**

Comprised of IT, information systems, and data analysis specialists, the Supply Chain Analytics Working group brings thought leadership, serious data crunching, and  robust visualizations and dashboards for our clients which include the PEPFAR program and USAID’s Office of the Chief Information Officer. 

The Working Group is led by John Yates, a former CIO, IT Advisor, and USAID Chief of Party who managed the implementation of the supply chain information system for the $9 billion USAID Global Health and Supply Chain – Procurement and Supply Management (GHSC-PSM) project. Leading partner engagement is Jordan Raupp, Associate Director of Business Development and former GHSC-PSM Senior Subcontracts Manager managing a $400 million portfolio of 12 sub-IDIQ contracts including IT services, 4th party logistics, and health systems services. Mr. Raupp explored integration of blockchain technology into supply chain operations and conducted assignments including as a Warehousing Specialist in the DRC. 

DevTech looks forward engaging clients and partners to bring expert data analytics and IT services to forward looking public and private sector supply chain actors like we do on the Nigeria Support for Strategic Information and Project Management Services (SIMS) project where we support data collection, analysis, quality improvement through the Office of Global AIDS Coordinator in Nigeria. DevTech’s data analytics capabilities can be further demonstrated under the ADVISE contract, where DevTech supports USAID’s [Foreign Aid Explorer](https://explorer.usaid.gov/) and [IDEA](https://idea.usaid.gov/) platforms to report on PEPFAR spending to the U.S. Congress.

DevTech is excited to bring these tools and analytical services to the supply chain sector. Anyone wishing to contact DevTech about supply chain services can email *scs@devtechsys.com* and a member of our team will be in touch with you as soon as possible!
