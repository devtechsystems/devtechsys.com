DevTech Systems today announced it has hired Leon “Skip” Waskin as Senior Director of Operations. He brings more than 35 years of international development experience and will be focused on shaping the firm’s strategic business development efforts and helping to manage business expansion and program management operations.

Mr. Waskin has spent much of his career as a senior foreign services officer, most recently as the Coordinator for Economic and Development Assistance at the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.  Some of his achievements in the foreign service include:

* As Deputy Mission Director with USAID/Pakistan for Sindh and Balochistan, he provided strategic leadership to and drove forward implementation of a $290 million portfolio focused on education and health infrastructure and community outreach efforts aimed at promoting stability and reducing the lure of violent extremism in these highly at-risk provinces.  
* In Haiti, he led a joint civilian/military team that coordinated the U.S. Government response to the devastating January 2010 earthquake, and led the design of a proposed $1 billion long-term development cooperation program between the United States and Haiti. 
* As USAID Mission Director in Afghanistan, he led that mission through a major increase in the size of its program, including a significant expansion of cooperation with the U.S. and ISAF military commands.

Prior to his assignment to Pakistan, Mr. Waskin worked with the Pax Mondial Group as its Senior Vice President for Stabilization & Development.  He led Pax Mondial’s successful effort to become a partner in a Framework Agreement with the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) for work in Fragile and Conflict Affected States, and significantly expanded the company’s relationships with the European Union and European Parliament.

“I have dedicated my career to helping governments and governmental organizations around the world achieve long-term stability, prosperity, and growth,” said Mr. Waskin.  “I am looking forward to putting that experience to use at DevTech, to help grow their unique data-driven approach to innovative solutions for international development.”

“We are excited to bring onboard someone with such extensive international senior management experience,” commented Rafael Romeau, President and Chief Executive Officer of DevTech.  “We have entered an intense new phase of growth, and he will play a crucial role in helping us and our customers achieve our goals.”
