â€œDevTech Systems Founder and Chairman, Dr. Jorge A. Sanguinetty, was quoted this April in the Latin America Advisor regarding the advent of increased automation in the work force and its potential to affect labor markets across Latin America.  Dr. Sanguinetty cited automation as a fundamental source of economic growth and development and a necessary condition to increase labor productivity. The need for efficient policies that stimulate job creation and compensate for jobs lost by technological innovation via the reform of rigid labor codes, and increasing contractual security and property rights to stimulate investment were stressed by Dr. Sanguinetty, who additionally weighed in on labor market potentials across Latin America in the post 2018 election context.
