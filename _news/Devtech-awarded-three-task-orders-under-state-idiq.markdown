DevTech Systems, Inc. continues to outperform by winning the **Evaluation of Internet Freedom Portfolio Activities (IFPA)**, the **Reform Analytics Project (RAP)**, and the **Evaluation of the Fiscal Transparency Innovation Fund (FTIF)**. 

The IFPA task order will provide the Internet Freedom team at State with data on which strategies should be continued, discontinued or adapted in future programming to facilitate success in meeting objectives, minimize risk of unintended outcomes, and develop publicly available information on the program and the extent of its effectiveness.  

The RAP will task DevTech to develop and pilot a foreign assistance analytical framework for Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia that the Office of the Assistance Coordinator for Europe, Eurasia and Central Asia (EUR/ACE) will use to assess the progress of partners towards achieving reform, sustainability, and resilience benchmarks. 

Finally, the FTIF task order will support the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs to improve processes for selecting, monitoring, and measuring technical assistance efforts that are designed and implemented--primarily by U.S. diplomatic missions abroad--to build public and institutional support for strong fiscal transparency regimes and reinforce U.S. Government foreign assistance policy priorities.

The total period of performance for each task order is one year.
