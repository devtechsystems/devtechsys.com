Description: "DevTech Systems, Inc. (DevTech) is an international consulting firm
  dedicated to development, with over 37 years of experience providing advisory services
  and technical assistance to government, private sector, and civil society stakeholders
  in more than 100 countries. We are a data driven organization that specializes in
  informing policy making by delivering focused data-driven evidence-based analysis
  products and services.  DevTech's core practice areas include Data Solutions; Public
  Financial Management; Monitoring, Evaluation, Research, and Learning; and Education,
  Gender and Youth.\n\nThe **Fiscal Accountability and Sustainable Trade (FAST)**
  task order supports rapid, sustainable, and equitable economic growth in USAID-assisted
  countries by enabling the Agency to bring a systems approach to addressing Public
  Financial Management (PFM; public revenue, budget, expenditure, and debt), trade
  capacity building (TCB), macroeconomic planning and policies, and other economic
  governance issues, such as regulatory reform, and by supporting Missions to improve
  1) host-country capacity to mobilize revenue and provide public services; 2) the
  policy climate for investment that generates more productive employment and inclusive
  growth, including issues specific to women and disadvantaged populations; 3) the
  host-country’s ability to recover from, prevent, and/or mitigate the impact of conflict,
  natural disasters, or fiscal crises; and 4) the host-country’s institutional capacity
  to identify, design, advocate, and implement better economic policies to enhance
  inclusive growth and gender equity.  \n\nThe attached [Terms of Reference](https://devtechsys.com/uploads/Final%20Draft%20RFP%20for%20Behavioral%20Economics%20Course%20with%20Template.pdf)

  course on behavioral economics in development in both theory and practice.  \n\nThe
  purpose of the project is three-fold:\n\n1.\tProvide a primer in behavioral science
  and economics to USAID staff, in the form of a training course, covering biases,
  decision theory, mental models, and how they can both hinder and be leveraged by
  economic growth and related programming.\n2.\tCreate a pilot training course to
  evaluate what methods of instruction are best suited for participants and the themes
  and subtopics that would be most useful for USAID programming.\n3.\tCreate and foster
  a community of USAID trained staff that have the knowledge and skills to promote
  behavioral and experimental economics insights within their Missions, Bureaus, and
  Operating Units. This community will champion the inclusion of behavioral economics
  and science in the Agency.\n\nNotification of interest, all questions, and final
  proposals should be submitted to [usaidfast@gmail.com](mailto: usaidfast@gmail.com)
