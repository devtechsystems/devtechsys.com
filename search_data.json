      "content"	 : "Nicaragua CARS ProjectIn the coastal communities of Nicaragua, young children are joining the fight to end human trafficking through an unlikely way: a puppet show. (Click here to view the video.)The puppet theater performance is called “Chef Gustof, a Nice Deceiver,” and it seeks to illuminate the often taboo yet very present risk of child trafficking on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua. The performance was designed and produced by a group of young student beneficiaries from the Community Action for Reading and Security (CARS) Activity funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) implemented by DevTech Systems, Inc.The puppet theater performance raises awareness and dispels myths about the prevalence and tactics used by traffickers by expressing first-hand accounts of child trafficking in the coastal communities. These first-hand experiences not only draw attention to the issue, but also and arguably more importantly, empower kids in these neighborhoods to take action.Prior to developing the training, the six primary school students received training on human trafficking, personal prevention strategies, and risks for children in order to deepen their understanding of the issue. Then they spent more than 20 hours developing the ideas, dialogues, scenography and production of the play, including audio recording, editing and choreography for a closing dance.The story recreates a scene in a local park, where young children meet a stranger named Chef Gustof, who manages to entice the children with false promises until they are eventually kidnapped by him. The child’s family and the authorities react in time and manage to capture the network of traffickers, leading to a happy ending to the story.“The stories of child trafficking do not always have a happy ending like this, in most cases the children who are victims of trafficking are not recovered and end up with very sad stories,” says Keysha, an eight-year-old member of the group who created the puppet play.“We decided to create a story with puppets because that is what kids enjoy, but we are also interested in presenting how traffickers show love and build trust until they create victims,” explains Heyman, 9 years old and a member of the group of actors.The puppets sing, dance, speak in rhyme, laugh, and cry to capture children’s attention, strengthen listening skills, and vocabulary development. They also warn children, parents, and community members about the dangers of trafficking and empower the audience to take action. The puppet show has been showcased at the American Chamber of Commerce in Nicaragua national business school fair, national and local TV channels, local fairs, and local radio and in a national newspaper.The DevTech initiative emphasizes arts and culture through drama to connect with audiences on a far more emotional level than most other education efforts, potentially leading to greater learning and eventual behavioral change. In schools, this puppet theater performance will continue to engage children, parents and community members in Nicaragua in making the path to peacebuilding a personal one.",

      "title": "Education in a Multi-Ethnic and Multi-Cultural Context: Understanding the past to comprehend the present",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "In order to understand the high illiteracy rate and educational context on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, it is necessary to take a look back at Nicaragua’s history.The “Mosquito Shore,” now known as the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, was militarily annexed to the Republic of Nicaragua in 1894 by President Jose Santos Zelaya. A few years after this military annexation, a presidential decree declared that all education in Nicaragua, which included the recently annexed Mosquito Shore, would be taught in Spanish. Many people on the Mosquito Shore, who did not speak Spanish, questioned why they were forced to learn in Spanish.Classes on the mosquito shore were previously given only in French and English and teachers were brought from Europe, USA, Jamaica and other countries. After the presidential decree, the Mosquito Shore’s Moravian Junior High School was renamed Colegio Moravo Secundaria. The high school had a reputation compared to universities from any part of Nicaragua and it had a very high rate of employability. But all of that would change.In 1909, the Moravian Junior high school closed for over 10 years, because it needed to transform its curriculum from French and English to Spanish. Administrators had to find Spanish teachers to teach classes in Spanish, but the students couldn’t speak or understand a word in Spanish. On the Caribbean coast, the students spoke primarily English, Miskito, Kriol, Garifuna, and Rama. Many parents reacted by keeping their children at home instead of sending them to class, causing several generations of people on the Caribbean coast to have no education at all. These generations could not even read or write.Nevertheless, over time kids started to attend the Colegio Moravo Secundaria and throughout the years, other schools opened with Spanish curriculum. Still, much of the history, language, culture, and identity of the Caribbean coast were not taught in the Spanish speaking schools. Over the years, it became apparent that the culture still had not assimilated to the curriculum.How complicated it is for teachers and students to teach and learn in a multicultural and multilingual context?The Indigenous and Afro-descendant people whose maternal language is not Spanish usually face more difficult experiences learning in school. They often face difficulty learning to read, both in Spanish and their mother tongue, mainly because grammar and classes in native languages are rarely taught in school, but they never speak Spanish at home. All early grade school language and math lessons are taught in Spanish, a language they barely know.When kids are at home, parents, mothers, and family members typically speak to their children in either Miskito or Kriol. These languages have prevailed since many people can’t fluently read or write Spanish in rural areas.This creates a problem. A Kriol speaking teacher with minimal Spanish will teach classes to a Kriol speaking child who also has minimal knowledge of Spanish. While the textbooks are in Spanish, teachers often resort to speaking Kriol or another native language. In another city, a Miskito teacher who speaks only enough Spanish to communicate, but does not know Spanish grammar, will use Spanish text to teach Miskito speaking children. Good intentions to bring Miskito or Kriol textbooks to rural areas are futile since children are not taught to read or write in their native tongue. The result is students who speak very little Spanish and read and write very little in their native language. Without a solid knowledge of either Spanish or their native tongue, students will continue to have a very low literacy rate on the Caribbean coast.This presents serious issues in the educational environment along the Caribbean coast. In order to increase the literacy rate and better prepare students, it is important to understand the past.",

      "title": "Knowledge Management and Communication Requires Participation",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "In recent years, the concept of Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management has become very popular in organizations, especially within the international development field. However, this trend extends beyond learning about project outcomes and it encompasses more than the process of one person reporting and analyzing the results of a project.In order for Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management to be an effective activity, it is crucial that everyone who participated to some extent in the project’s execution is subsequently involved in communicating the outcomes, success stories, achievements, and improvement opportunities to the different audiences. It should not be limited to one on one interactions or any other limited structure like the Shannon-Weaver Model of Communication, developed in 1949, which simplified the channel of communication into a one-way process from sender to receiver.Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management objectives can be achieved if the learning process is executed as a group activity where different points of view are shared between those who worked on a project and the audience so that different ideas and opinions are fully exchanged. The end result of this dialogue should be the development of better practices for the future, whether in international development or any other field.For many, Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management is limited to gathering information and presenting it in reports, which many people do not read, and worst of all, it is not taken into consideration for future proposals and projects. It is important that this concept becomes more than just a title and that it transforms into a useful and beneficial practice for the benefit of all.An inclusive communications strategy should be developed for this concept to work to its fullest potential. The idea is to make key actors in a specific industry or topic more involved and informed on the outcomes of a project. As a result of this practice, both sides participate and become agents of change when working on future projects.There is no formula for this process, but there are good practices that can be mimicked to lead Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management teams. The goal is that everyone can comfortably manage information and trace a route to communicate in an effective way. The mission of this effort is to engage more with the public interested in the topic. A key concept in Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management is accountability. This term is very important when working on collaborative projects.Accountability is defined as the process of sharing the knowledge acquired from a specific project in a transparent manner. Part of this transparency includes sharing with the public information about the entities that donated funds to make the project possible and how those funds were invested. By adding accountability to the Leaning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management process, you complete the cycle of information management.",

      "title": "Combating Chronic Malnutrition in Guatemala",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Nutrition during the first years of life is an essential component for human development. Malnutrition can be caused by a lack or excess of food. Malnutrition due to lack of food can be classified in 3 types:  Acute: Underweight and stunted growth  Chronic: Stunted growth  Global: UnderweightThe excess of nutrition during the first years of life is very likely to cause obesity. In Guatemala in particular, among children under the age of five, 46.5% of are stunted, 4.7% are overweight, and 1% are wasted (UNICEF, Monitoring the Situation of Children and Women, 2015).Acute malnutrition must be treated immediately and children diagnosed with this type of malnutrition should receive special treatment since there is a high risk of death.Chronic malnutrition is relatively silent; children with this disease generally don’t receive a diagnosis. Guatemala is the country with the highest risk of chronic malnutrition in Latin America and the 5th in the world. This makes chronic malnutrition the biggest nutrition issue among Guatemalan children.According to the Maternal-Infant nutrition glossary:Chronic Malnutrition is also called “stunting.” It is the result of a bad nutrition for long periods of time or episodes of infection.  It’s a deficiency developed in the long run, which manifests as not growing up properly (short height) and can cause irreversible damages to the brain.Anthropometric data on children under 5 years were captured during the Monitoring and Evaluation Survey of the Occidental High Plateau, with the objective of calculating the main indicators of infant nutrition.The following graph presents the behavior of chronic malnutrition in the first 59 months (5 years) of life. You can see in the graph that the risk of chronic malnutrition doubles between 6 to 24 months.It is evident that children between the ages of 6 to 24 months are more vulnerable. One cause could be that they consume less breastmilk. From 24 months onward, the risk of chronic malnutrition remains very constant.Because of these high risks, Guatemala has programs to prevent chronic malnutrition, especially within the first 1,000 days of a child’s life, which includes the period between conception to the time the child is 24 months old.",

These were:Civil Society Programs require a long-term strategy USAID/DR’s foresight to support the initiative over a 10-year period was critical. It provided the necessary time to build the projects carefully, let them take hold, and eventually reach out to a broad and receptive public. Changing political culture needs at least a decade ****One step behind approach is critical An essential part of the strategy to promote democracy in the DR was to maintain a low profile, allowing the Dominican grantees to take the visible lead in pushing for democratic reforms. This one step behind strategy conferred legitimacy and credibility to the effort as a Dominican initiative and was key to its success.Flexibility Given the fluidity of the political situation in the DR, it was essential for the USAID Mission to support a &quot;demand&quot; rather than a &quot;supply&quot; driven initiative. This approach helped to build momentum and contributed to the sustainability of the initiative.",

The BPS Project’s goal was to help the GFRN solidify institutional roles in the budget preparation process and establish a multi-year budgeting capability. The project provided technical assistance and training in the areas of planning processes, budget preparation and formulation, budget execution, and organizational development. DevTech provided technical assistance in organizational development to the Budget Office of the Federation (BOF) in the Ministry of Finance and to the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence (BMPI) Unit of the Office of the President.The BOF was divided into several departments that had historically functioned as separate entities, with little understanding or incentive for aligning each department under a unifying overall objective, resulting in inefficiency, mismanagement, and unclear roles. Thus, DevTech conducted a participatory analysis of the departments, and then helped them to clearly define their respective roles in the budget process regarding the overall BOF strategic plan. Following this exercise, DevTech helped BOF staff develop departmental objectives that were in alignment with the overall BOF objectives, with measurable performance indicators built into each objective. DevTech staff also provided input into the development of a training program.The BMPI unit was responsible for ensuring that the Office of the President was fully informed about the budgetary process at three levels:  Budget Formulation—providing a pool of experts and a Price Intelligence Database (PID) tool to ensure accuracy and authenticity of expenditure proposals submitted by various governmental units;  Budget Prioritization—establishing the strategic and planning priorities for future allocation of resources; and  Budget Execution—enhancing the efficiency and the effectiveness of programs and service delivery as well as the overall management of resources.The BMPI Unit’s staff members were mostly contract hires and the BMPI Unit Director planned to have these positions and these staff &quot;regularized&quot; into the civil service, as full-time staff.To help the BMPI Unit achieve its goals, DevTech assessed consultants’ contracts and assisted with planning for the transition of consultancies to full-time staff. DevTech staff reviewed the consultants’ perceptions regarding their work with the BMPI vis-à-vis their career development targets; identified factors that inhibit and stimulate the staff in their current roles, and incentives that would make employment more attractive; and provided a methodology to regularize the consulting staff of the BMPI within the civil service structure, upon full-time enrollment. DevTech also conducted an evaluation of existing skills of personnel and identified additional skills required of sector specialists and training needs; helped BMPI staff define personnel job descriptions and create a nomenclature of compensation; identified ways to attract additional expertise into the BMPI Unit; identified a transition strategy for departing staff (sector specialists) and new hires; defined recruitment procedures for new hires; and reviewed and developed organizational performance, standards of performance, appraisal, and teamwork.",

DevTech is working in close partnership with local organizations to implement an evidence-based approach to conduct activities at the municipal, community, and school level to transition to a local-led model to educational development and citizen security.DevTech has designed, developed, and managed the CARS activity to improve the quality of education for at-risk children and improve citizen security, working in partnership with local organizations that deliver services within a framework of effective monitoring, evaluation, and evidence-based decision making. Additionally, CARS results support the achievement of goals one and three of USAID’s education strategy by implementing a series of interventions under four mutually reinforcing components:  formal and non-formal reading programs;  community engagement;  local capacity development; and  knowledge generation and management.Under CARS, DevTech has developed RACCS/RACCN specific education materials for teachers in English, Miskitu, and Spanish including teacher guides, student lesson books, and supplementary reading materials to improve the material that teachers have in the participating schools. Additionally, we worked closely to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate reading materials (50 titles per grade) in Spanish, Miskitu, and Creole. All materials are aligned with the SEAR and the national curriculum, and include stories written by youth about resilience to drugs and violence, stories written by children about pride in their culture and dreams for the future of their community.The CARS activity also offers a weekend diploma program which provides teachers the opportunity to earn a diploma in improved active teaching-learning methodologies.

        "content"  : "DevTech has been the prime contractor for the Economic Analysis and Data Services (EADS), an information system providing macro-level international economic and social statistical data to the USG for over 20 years. The Economic Analysis and Data Services is USAID’s central source for U.S. foreign assistance data, international socioeconomic data, and data-driven analysis in support of USAID goals. EADS manages six databases and five public websites (https://eads.usaid.gov), containing data from across the Agency, U.S. Government, and international development organizations. EADS generates the data in three of the databases through data calls to USG agencies, different parts of USAID and USAID partners. The fourth database collects international socioeconomic data from reputable sources and makes them available to USAID, its partners and the public, through unique data visualizations and tools on one convenient site. The six databases are the following:  Foreign Aid Database - This database is the basis for the US government annual reporting of foreign assistance data to Congress (the Greenbook), as well as US government’s annual reporting to the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (USAAR: U.S. Government’s Annual Assistance Report). It contains all US government foreign assistance data from 1946 to the present. This data is available publicly via the Foreign Aid Explorer (FAE) website.  Economic and Social Database - collects country level economic and social data from around the world, from sources such as the World Bank, IMF, UN agencies, and US government sources as well (e.g. USAID’s Demographic and Health Surveys). It brings these sources into one location on the International Data and Economic Analysis (IDEA) website,  and makes them easily acessable to USAID staff, facilitating identification of appropriate and updated data.  Trade Capacity Building Database - reports all trade capacity building activities from the U.S. government.  Microenterprise Results Reporting Database - source of data for USAID’s reporting of its microenterprise supporting activities in compliance with the Microenterprise Results and Accountability Act (MRAA) of 2004.  Foreign Assistance Data Redaction System (FADRS) – has helped to institutionalize redactions by housing all redaction requests in a central web interface. It has also streamlined the process of reporting and protected the privacy of staff by making it easier to remove personally identifiable information.  Tying Status Aid Database (TSAD) - reporting tied/untied procurement/grant actions to the OECD, Department of the Treasury, and the Export-Import Bank of the U.S.Based on the databases maintained by EADS, the EADS team of economists and data scientists responds to requests for data, analysis, and visualizations from USAID and its partners and supports USAID operations at headquarters and in the field. These requests have resulted in the creation of a number of products including country profiles updated 2-3 times per year, analytical briefs, snapshots (summaries) of recent data releases, and special studies. By providing USAID staff with a central data source, backed by a team of experienced economists and data analysts, EADS improves the efficiency of USAID’s operations and the quality of its handling and reporting of international development data.EADS launched a new Country Dashboard feature to the IDEA website, which is an interactive data visualization tool that allows USAID staff to compare a country with selected groups of countries and assess its progress over time. The Dashboard compares countries across eight sectors, 45 subsectors, and 335 indicators and provides the most up-to-date data. It shows selected indicators for countries that USAID assists, benchmarked against regional data or data for countries of similar income. Users can compare country values with income groups and regional averages, or view the trend line and ranking of a specific indicator. The country dashboard brings several benefits to our IDEA website: it allows users to benchmark data against regional averages and the average of countries of similar income; it adds visual appeal; and it provides users with a selected subset.EADS is also responsible for providing the Finding and Using Development Data (FUDD) training to USAID staff, which is offered three times per year in Arlington, VA. EADS recently produced an online version of the class, which is now available to all USAID staff and used primarily in the field at USAID’s missions. USAID staff from all sectors and bureaus use FUDD to better understand, analyze, and visualize the wealth of development date available in their specific line of work.",

To conduct this evaluation, the DevTech Team has nominated a combination of home office staff, and both American and Egyptian consultants with experience in evaluating higher education projects to effectively and efficiently carry out the evaluation.The purposes of this evaluation were to: (1) identify the Cairo Initiative’s strengths and weaknesses and make any corrections needed, (2) review, analyze, and evaluate the USAID-funded Cairo Initiative in terms of achieving program objectives, and (3) provide findings and recommendations to be used by the Government of Egypt and USAID to help in future designs of human capacity-building projects.For this performance evaluation, a mixed-methods approach was used to collect and analyze primary and secondary source data. The methods consisted of: a literature review, key informant interviews, group discussions, and an opinion survey. Data were triangulated and the team ensured that primary data took account of a set of variables (e.g., type of organization). The evaluation team interviewed 97 from a range of CISP target organizations and stakeholder organizations.

        "content"  : "DevTech was the prime contractor on USAID’s Decentralization and Local Governance program in Guatemala. DevTech provided technical assistance in municipalities and coordinated assistance for national-level institutions to improve the capacity to support decentralization. In two cases, contract results were modified mid-course due to changes in Government of Guatemala requirements for municipalities. DevTech conducted the necessary technical analysis to adjust the program activities and re-target assistance. DevTech also helped the Governor of the San Marcos Department establish a system for municipalities to implement reconstruction activities and monitor reconstruction projects in the aftermath of Hurricane Stan.DevTech incorporated an integrated performance monitoring system for its work at the local government level, which includes indicators for more than 20 lower-level results, and data collection (baseline and yearly) in 15 municipalities. The system served as a basis for establishing indicators of municipal development and guided program activities.The Program had four Sub-Intermediate Results (IR):  Sub-IR 2.1 More transparent systems for management of public resources by local governments  Sub-IR 2.2 Increased devolution of responsibilities and resources to the local level resulting in greater responsiveness by local governments to citizens’ needs  Sub-IR 2.3 More opportunities for citizen participation in and oversight of local government decision-making  Sub-IR 2.4 Local capacity for the development and implementation of reconstruction program strengthened in the San Marcos Department.The Sub-IR 2.1.indicator measured the improvement in the fiscal performance of the selected municipalities. For the 13 selected Program municipalities, intergovernmental transfers were, on average, 92 percent of total revenues in 2008. The annual rate of growth of own-source revenues for the 13 selected municipalities increased from -0.5 percent in 2005 to 41.2 percent in 2008.Technical assistance was delivered through three mechanisms:  Updating the municipal fees schedules;  Improving operating regulations and collection of fees for municipal services; and  Strengthening policies to reduce the avoidance of the payment of municipal services.In addition to the improvement in revenue collection, the Program successfully strengthened the public financial management systems at the municipal level. These included a public procurement system, financial management system, auditing units, and internal controls. In the base year of 2005, the average score for the 13 municipalities was 31 out of 100 points. When the Program closed in September 2009, the average had increased to 89 out of 100 points.Sub-IR 2.2. increased devolution of responsibilities and greater responsiveness to citizen needs. The focus of the activities in this Sub-IR was to change the dynamics at the national level for decentralization.The Program:  Developed a proposal for a municipal tax code and a municipal code;  Introduced a solution for the problem of municipal debt;  Designed a Single-Window for Municipal Projects as the mechanism to improve the coordination of national and municipal public investment; and  Provided legal assistance for the revision of the statutes of national-level municipal associations to reform their reform its governance structure.The indicator for Sub-IR 2.3 was defined as: “Number of Municipalities with Municipal Development Council (COMUDE) Citizen Participation Commissions operating”. Although the target was seven (7) COMUDEs, by the end of the Program 10 COMUDEs had been established and were functioning with the appropriate commissions and committees. Those formed included the participation of municipal authorities and community leaders. These commissions monitored the commitments made by the COMUDE. In addition, the commissions were conceived as a space to improve the quality, not only the number, of women participating. The Program experience suggests that women participate more actively in small groups. Over the course of the four years of field implementation, a total of 22,744 persons participated in training workshops, COMUDEs, and Commissions (not exclusive to Citizen Participation). Of this total, 24.8 percent were women.Sub-IR 2.4., local capacity for the development and implementation of reconstruction program strengthened in the San Marcos Department.At the request of USAID, Sub-IR 2.4 was added to the Program to contribute to the reconstruction process in the Department of San Marcos in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Stan. In the aftermath of Hurricane Stan, DevTech provided technical assistance during a two-year period to 14 municipalities as well as the governor’s office to track and manage rehabilitation projects to ensure their completion, and strengthen the Municipal Planning Offices and COMUDES to take a pro-active role in the process. A tangible outcome was the design of an easy-to-use management information system for monitoring infrastructure projects that can be used at the municipal levels. The Program has worked with the Secretariat of Decentralization (SCEP) to establish a one-stop window for processing municipal investment projects, and also worked with SCEP and Executive Secretariat of Planning and Programming to replicate the program as a model across the country.",

The number of tax tickets levied on markets has increased threefold, which clearly indicates an increase in the number of commercial transactions. The volume of agricultural products sold in markets has increased fivefold, and transportation time has decreased to one-sixth of what it was, since the average speed on improved roads has increased from 6 kilometers per hour (kdh) to 35 kdh.

At the time of the evaluation, the ALP was implemented in 10 counties by 11 implementing partners.The Evaluation Team dedicated three months in Liberia to assess:  The coverage and impact of the USAID-funded ALPP intervention after 18 months of implementation; and  The relative efficacy and appropriateness of the overall ALP model for students aged 15 and older as implemented by the 11 partner agencies.The evaluation design included classroom observations, focus groups, and student testing.The Evaluation Team traveled to the six counties where ALPP was implemented, visiting a total of 18 school sites and covering the educational programs of the USAID-implemented ALPP, Partner-implemented ALPs, and MoE-run Conventional Primary School Grades 1-6. Data was collected through 39 classroom observations as well as focus groups/interviews that were carried out with a number of stakeholders. These stakeholders included: Ministry of Education personnel, partner organizations, County and District Education Officers, principals, community members, Parent-Teacher Associations, youth groups and students.To assess the learning outcomes of ALP students and determine the overall effectiveness of the program, the Team developed and administered assessment instruments in Mathematics and Language Arts for ALP Levels II and III. The exams were designed to assess proficiency in specific skills such as subtraction, division, use of pronouns, and comprehension. To provide comparative data, the tests were also administered to students in MoE Grades 3 and 5 and to students in ALP partner programs. In total, 806 students were tested by the DevTech team.To complement the evaluation aspects of the assignment, DevTech delivered three capacity building workshops to staff of the implementing partners and other Liberian educators.  The purpose was to increase the capacity of ALP Implementing Partners to develop instructional assessments to collect and use data on ALP student learning outcomes to improve the ability to collect, manage, and analyze data through improved database skills, and to develop a common monitoring tool and reliable database for ALP/ALPP programs.",

The project aimed to change the business practices of branches of the federal government so they would integrate the TRRS into their operations, strengthening the capacity of the AGF to complete the consolidation of accounting information from all Ministries and agencies in a timely manner, and ensuring that consolidated data was used to perform real-time audits. Trainings enhanced accountants’ capacity to enter information into the TRRS and auditors’ capacity both in the AGF and AGO to perform real-time audits of government agencies, offices, aid Ministries.As part of this initiative, DevTech developed an organizational change management (OCM) strategy for the TRRS, and worked with other project team members to implement it. The purpose of the OCM strategy was to ensure that all system users were fully aware of the changes taking place as a result of the new system, and understood their respective roles in the organization.",

DevTech provided a Budget Advisor, who helped the Ministry of Finance design and incorporate policies, procedures, and programs that ensured all government ministries develop and execute balanced budgets that reflected their respective short-, medium- and long-term strategies, priorities, and objectives. The Budget Advisor trained various line-ministries and conducted strategic planning while helping to build the capacity of the ministries’ staff with regards to program or performance based budgeting (PPB). DevTech also helped the Ministry of Finance to establish a more effective revenue and expenditures structure that was consistent with the new market economy driven government functions.Phase IIIn 2003, the project shifted focus from federal ministries to the sub-national level. DevTech began promoting fiscal decentralization and equitable allocation of resources, and trained local officials to increase their budgeting and financial management expertise and capabilities. The Senior Budget Advisor, based in Khmelnitsky, became Chief of Party. As such, he assisted local governments in Lviv and Poltava to improve their financial position through PPB, resulting in more autonomy and accountability. DevTech led a nationwide budget training to raion and subraion finance officers, focusing on the opportunities and requirements mandated in Ukraine’s new Budget Code. Three oblasts and their cooperating jurisdictions used PPB for their 2005–2007 budgets, thus demonstrating a capacity to implement improved budgeting approaches. They were then selected to participate in an intense training program with seminars, workshops, and mini-trainings, which served as a PPB Pilot Project to be replicated on a wider scale. DevTech also provided critical technical input into the extension of the Budget Code to lower levels of local government, specifically to subraion levels.",

Thus, while we use an analysis of the PDE as a methodological recourse, and we do make certain “process” suggestions, we also make some recommendations regarding the substantive nature of the reforms that are needed.In order to carry out a profound analysis of the roots of the educational problems that have been affecting the Dominican Republic for many years, we applied an eclectic methodological approach that combines traditional empirical analysis with personal accounts of the most important events and conditions.
