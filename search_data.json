      "content"	 : "In order to understand the high illiteracy rate and educational context on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, it is necessary to take a look back at Nicaragua’s history.The “Mosquito Shore,” now known as the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, was militarily annexed to the Republic of Nicaragua in 1894 by President Jose Santos Zelaya. A few years after this military annexation, a presidential decree declared that all education in Nicaragua, which included the recently annexed Mosquito Shore, would be taught in Spanish. Many people on the Mosquito Shore, who did not speak Spanish, questioned why they were forced to learn in Spanish.Classes on the mosquito shore were previously given only in French and English and teachers were brought from Europe, USA, Jamaica and other countries. After the presidential decree, the Mosquito Shore’s Moravian Junior High School was renamed Colegio Moravo Secundaria. The high school had a reputation compared to universities from any part of Nicaragua and it had a very high rate of employability. But all of that would change.In 1909, the Moravian Junior high school closed for over 10 years, because it needed to transform its curriculum from French and English to Spanish. Administrators had to find Spanish teachers to teach classes in Spanish, but the students couldn’t speak or understand a word in Spanish. On the Caribbean coast, the students spoke primarily English, Miskito, Kriol, Garifuna, and Rama. Many parents reacted by keeping their children at home instead of sending them to class, causing several generations of people on the Caribbean coast to have no education at all. These generations could not even read or write.Nevertheless, over time kids started to attend the Colegio Moravo Secundaria and throughout the years, other schools opened with Spanish curriculum. Still, much of the history, language, culture, and identity of the Caribbean coast were not taught in the Spanish speaking schools. Over the years, it became apparent that the culture still had not assimilated to the curriculum.How complicated it is for teachers and students to teach and learn in a multicultural and multilingual context?The Indigenous and Afro-descendant people whose maternal language is not Spanish usually face more difficult experiences learning in school. They often face difficulty learning to read, both in Spanish and their mother tongue, mainly because grammar and classes in native languages are rarely taught in school, but they never speak Spanish at home. All early grade school language and math lessons are taught in Spanish, a language they barely know.When kids are at home, parents, mothers, and family members typically speak to their children in either Miskito or Kriol. These languages have prevailed since many people can’t fluently read or write Spanish in rural areas.This creates a problem. A Kriol speaking teacher with minimal Spanish will teach classes to a Kriol speaking child who also has minimal knowledge of Spanish. While the textbooks are in Spanish, teachers often resort to speaking Kriol or another native language. In another city, a Miskito teacher who speaks only enough Spanish to communicate, but does not know Spanish grammar, will use Spanish text to teach Miskito speaking children. Good intentions to bring Miskito or Kriol textbooks to rural areas are futile since children are not taught to read or write in their native tongue. The result is students who speak very little Spanish and read and write very little in their native language. Without a solid knowledge of either Spanish or their native tongue, students will continue to have a very low literacy rate on the Caribbean coast.This presents serious issues in the educational environment along the Caribbean coast. In order to increase the literacy rate and better prepare students, it is important to understand the past.",

      "title": "Knowledge Management and Communication Requires Participation",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "In recent years, the concept of Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management has become very popular in organizations, especially within the international development field. However, this trend extends beyond learning about project outcomes and it encompasses more than the process of one person reporting and analyzing the results of a project.In order for Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management to be an effective activity, it is crucial that everyone who participated to some extent in the project’s execution is subsequently involved in communicating the outcomes, success stories, achievements, and improvement opportunities to the different audiences. It should not be limited to one on one interactions or any other limited structure like the Shannon-Weaver Model of Communication, developed in 1949, which simplified the channel of communication into a one-way process from sender to receiver.Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management objectives can be achieved if the learning process is executed as a group activity where different points of view are shared between those who worked on a project and the audience so that different ideas and opinions are fully exchanged. The end result of this dialogue should be the development of better practices for the future, whether in international development or any other field.For many, Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management is limited to gathering information and presenting it in reports, which many people do not read, and worst of all, it is not taken into consideration for future proposals and projects. It is important that this concept becomes more than just a title and that it transforms into a useful and beneficial practice for the benefit of all.An inclusive communications strategy should be developed for this concept to work to its fullest potential. The idea is to make key actors in a specific industry or topic more involved and informed on the outcomes of a project. As a result of this practice, both sides participate and become agents of change when working on future projects.There is no formula for this process, but there are good practices that can be mimicked to lead Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management teams. The goal is that everyone can comfortably manage information and trace a route to communicate in an effective way. The mission of this effort is to engage more with the public interested in the topic. A key concept in Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management is accountability. This term is very important when working on collaborative projects.Accountability is defined as the process of sharing the knowledge acquired from a specific project in a transparent manner. Part of this transparency includes sharing with the public information about the entities that donated funds to make the project possible and how those funds were invested. By adding accountability to the Leaning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management process, you complete the cycle of information management.",

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Nutrition during the first years of life is an essential component for human development. Malnutrition can be caused by a lack or excess of food. Malnutrition due to lack of food can be classified in 3 types:  Acute: Underweight and stunted growth  Chronic: Stunted growth  Global: UnderweightThe excess of nutrition during the first years of life is very likely to cause obesity. In Guatemala in particular, among children under the age of five, 46.5% of are stunted, 4.7% are overweight, and 1% are wasted (UNICEF, Monitoring the Situation of Children and Women, 2015).Acute malnutrition must be treated immediately and children diagnosed with this type of malnutrition should receive special treatment since there is a high risk of death.Chronic malnutrition is relatively silent; children with this disease generally don’t receive a diagnosis. Guatemala is the country with the highest risk of chronic malnutrition in Latin America and the 5th in the world. This makes chronic malnutrition the biggest nutrition issue among Guatemalan children.According to the Maternal-Infant nutrition glossary:Chronic Malnutrition is also called “stunting.” It is the result of a bad nutrition for long periods of time or episodes of infection.  It’s a deficiency developed in the long run, which manifests as not growing up properly (short height) and can cause irreversible damages to the brain.Anthropometric data on children under 5 years were captured during the Monitoring and Evaluation Survey of the Occidental High Plateau, with the objective of calculating the main indicators of infant nutrition.The following graph presents the behavior of chronic malnutrition in the first 59 months (5 years) of life. You can see in the graph that the risk of chronic malnutrition doubles between 6 to 24 months.It is evident that children between the ages of 6 to 24 months are more vulnerable. One cause could be that they consume less breastmilk. From 24 months onward, the risk of chronic malnutrition remains very constant.Because of these high risks, Guatemala has programs to prevent chronic malnutrition, especially within the first 1,000 days of a child’s life, which includes the period between conception to the time the child is 24 months old.",

Countries offer different investor and creditor protections - often in response to their particular legal tradition - and the result is typically different evolutionary paths for financial markets. Analysis of the data shows that the presence of about half the possible investor protections is associated with larger stock market capitalizations, but that the presence of more protections than that is not associated with increases in capitalization.",

        "title": "Education Reform Evaluation in the Dominican Republic",
        "type": "Project",
        "content"  : "In 1990, the Dominican Republic embarked on a process of basic education reform with the consensus of civil society organizations and the Government of the Dominican Republic. The debates led to a comprehensive 10-year reform plan—the Plan Decenal—begun in 1992.Through a task order under the Evaluation IQC, DevTech conducted an external evaluation of the Plan Decenal’s achievements. The evaluation’s main goal was to provide guidelines for a new stage of the reform process. DevTech presented an objective and critical assessment of the reforms in order to involve all sectors of the Dominican population in the development of a second Plan Decenal. The evaluation found that, while the education sector continued to suffer from under-development, there was promise in public-private partnerships in the education sector. The evaluation identified eight principles for educational reform:Principle No. 1: Education cannot be improved by trying to change everything at the same time. A feasible reform program (vis-à-vis the theoretically optimal one) should concentrate on achieving a few critical goals and advance from there in successive stages.Principle No. 2: Education reform with the depth the Dominican Republic needs cannot be achieved during the tenure of one government administration. In fact, the necessary changes may require the consistent effort of several administrations from different political parties. That is why a successful reform program must be non-partisan and consensus-driven, though we are strongly of the opinion that a consensus base is not enough; the reform also has to be sensible (e.g., it cannot assume the equivalent of the Earth being flat).Principle No. 3: Good management does not come from authority, political power, or hierarchy. Good management is an advanced skill and cannot be improvised or achieve by appointing trusted aides. Education reform is a highly complex and involved process that requires top quality managers. If they are not available, it should be imported on the same basis that technical assistance and external resources are being brought from external sources.Principle No. 4: Reform goals must be achievable with the resources currently available under a hard budget constraint. If those targets are below what the Dominican economy and society at large require, more resources must be made available. If the targets overshoot their possibilities, they will contribute to disorganize the effort and make it fail.Principle No. 5: As a corollary to Principle 1, a given improvement of a reform program cannot be implemented equally in all institutions at the same time. As the reform effort advances, there will be inequalities of implementation simply because some agents are more skillful than others, but this should not be an impediment to the advance of the reforms.Principle No. 6: At least some of the proposed solutions should ideally be administratively feasible in the Dominican Republic, by the Dominican state, as it exists today. It should not be necessary to assume a state that is more administratively capable than currently exists, in order to implement all of the project’s points. Some points in the project should be implementable even if there is no improvement whatever in the administrative capacity of the state.Principle No. 7: One should start from the final goal and reason back. The final goal is for children to have more access to schooling and to learn more. Everything else is an intermediate goal.Principle No. 8: Improving capacity (e.g., improving capacity of principals to manage, or teachers to teach), without creating accountability mechanisms to create incentives to use that capacity is largely useless unless one is willing to make the unwarrantedly romantic assumption that teachers and principals will work hard and, just for love of the craft. However, to create accountability pressure mechanisms without also expanding the personal and institutional supply capacity is also largely useless since there is nothing with which to respond to the accountability pressure.The end product of DevTech’s technical assistance served as input for a strategic planning exercise that the future Minister had requested and consisted of an initial diagnosis, policies and strategies, provincial planning, and pilot project design.The evaluation was widely cited at the time and utilized as a key input into the planning process of the government.",

The data from the nation-wide survey was then cross-analyzed to draw conclusions about the impact of program activities.The Assessment team concluded that there were several key factors critical to the success of implementing a program to strengthen civil society in the Dominican Republic. These were:Civil Society Programs require a long-term strategy. USAID/DR’s foresight to support the initiative over a 10-year period was critical. It provided the necessary time to build the projects carefully, let them take hold, and eventually reach out to a broad and receptive public. Changing political culture needs at least a decade.One step behind approach is critical. An essential part of the strategy to promote democracy in the DR was to maintain a low profile, allowing the Dominican grantees to take the visible lead in pushing for democratic reforms. This one step behind strategy conferred legitimacy and credibility to the effort as a Dominican initiative and was key to its success.Flexibility. Given the fluidity of the political situation in the DR, it was essential for the USAID Mission to support a &quot;demand&quot; rather than a &quot;supply&quot; driven initiative.

DevTech provided a Budget Advisor, who helped the Ministry of Finance design and incorporate policies, procedures, and programs that ensured all government ministries develop and execute balanced budgets that reflected their respective short-, medium- and long-term strategies, priorities, and objectives. The Budget Advisor trained various line-ministries and conducted strategic planning while helping to build the capacity of the ministries’ staff with regards to program or performance based budgeting (PPB). DevTech also helped the Ministry of Finance to establish a more effective revenue and expenditures structure that was consistent with the new market economy driven government functions.Phase IIIn 2003, the project shifted focus from federal ministries to the sub-national level. DevTech began promoting fiscal decentralization and equitable allocation of resources, and trained local officials to increase their budgeting and financial management expertise and capabilities. The Senior Budget Advisor, based in Khmelnytsky, became Chief of Party. As such, he assisted local governments in Lviv and Poltava to improve their financial position through PPB, resulting in more autonomy and accountability. DevTech led a nationwide budget training to raion and subraion finance officers, focusing on the opportunities and requirements mandated in Ukraine’s new Budget Code. Three oblasts and their cooperating jurisdictions used PPB for their 2005–2007 budgets, thus demonstrating a capacity to implement improved budgeting approaches. They were then selected to participate in an intense training program with seminars, workshops, and mini-trainings, which served as a PPB Pilot Project to be replicated on a wider scale.

Several studies were completed that informed the reform of the Superintendency of Tax Administration (SAT, acronym in Spanish), and continued to be listed on the SAT’s website. These included:&quot;Guatemala: Los Costos Administrativos de la Tributación y de Impuestos de Bajo Rendimiento&quot; by Dr. Arthur Mann. This study analyzed the costs of collecting &quot;minor&quot; taxes compared with the revenue they generate.Evaluating existing tax holidays and fiscal incentives (tax exemptions, exonerations, compensations, and deductions) to determine their cost to the Government of Guatemala compared to the relative economic benefits generated.&quot;Aplicación de Mejores Prácticas Internacionales al Desempeño de la Administración Tributaria de Guatemala: Un Estudio De Benchmarking.&quot; This &quot;benchmarking&quot; study of the Superintendency of Tax Administration, compared existing policies and operational practices of the Guatemalan Tax Authority with policies and practices of similar institutions in other countries. The results of this study were applied to other countries.

The BPS Project’s goal was to help the GFRN solidify institutional roles in the budget preparation process and establish a multi-year budgeting capability. The project provided technical assistance and training in the areas of planning processes, budget preparation and formulation, budget execution, and organizational development. DevTech provided technical assistance in organizational development to the Budget Office of the Federation (BOF) in the Ministry of Finance and to the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence (BMPI) Unit of the Office of the President.The BOF was divided into several departments that had historically functioned as separate entities, with little understanding or incentive for aligning each department under a unifying overall objective, resulting in inefficiency, mismanagement, and unclear roles. Thus, DevTech conducted a participatory analysis of the departments, and then helped them to clearly define their respective roles in the budget process regarding the overall BOF strategic plan. Following this exercise, DevTech helped BOF staff develop departmental objectives that were in alignment with the overall BOF objectives, with measurable performance indicators built into each objective. DevTech staff also provided input into the development of a training program.The BMPI unit was responsible for ensuring that the Office of the President was fully informed about the budgetary process at three levels:Budget Formulation—providing a pool of experts and a Price Intelligence Database (PID) tool to ensure accuracy and authenticity of expenditure proposals submitted by various governmental units;Budget Prioritization—establishing the strategic and planning priorities for future allocation of resources; andBudget Execution—enhancing the efficiency and the effectiveness of programs and service delivery as well as the overall management of resources.The BMPI Unit’s staff members were mostly contract hires and the BMPI Unit Director planned to have these positions and these staff &quot;regularized&quot; into the civil service, as full-time staff.To help the BMPI Unit achieve its goals, DevTech assessed consultants’ contracts and assisted with planning for the transition of consultancies to full-time staff. DevTech staff reviewed the consultants’ perceptions regarding their work with the BMPI vis-à-vis their career development targets; identified factors that inhibit and stimulate the staff in their current roles, and incentives that would make employment more attractive; and provided a methodology to regularize the consulting staff of the BMPI within the civil service structure, upon full-time enrollment. DevTech also conducted an evaluation of existing skills of personnel and identified additional skills required of sector specialists and training needs; helped BMPI staff define personnel job descriptions and create a nomenclature of compensation; identified ways to attract additional expertise into the BMPI Unit; identified a transition strategy for departing staff (sector specialists) and new hires; defined recruitment procedures for new hires; and reviewed and developed organizational performance, standards of performance, appraisal, and teamwork.",

These efforts helped the Commission better articulate the demand for fiscal decentralization in the country and develop specific initiatives to reform/improve upon existing laws, regulations, and practices.As part of this effort, DevTech:&amp;gt;Assessed the state of intergovernmental relations, including distribution of revenues, spending, etc., and the legal framework for the federal and state constitutions and local government law;&amp;gt;Trained members of the Commission in transfer systems, assignment of roles and responsibilities, service delivery models and best practices based on international experience;&amp;gt;Designed and supervised a variety of technical studies; and&amp;gt;Organized a seminar to review these studies and to arrive at a consensus on the future of fiscal federalism.DevTech helped the Instituto para el Desarrollo Técnico de las Haciendas Públicas (INDETEC) publish these studies in a single volume book titled: Enfoques Alternativos del Federalismo Fiscal en México (Alternative Foci for Fiscal Federalism in Mexico).This final work represented a broad consensus for reform, endorsed by the major players, but based on solid technical analysis. The broad distribution and discussion of this book helped ensure that these issues would start to rise to the top of the political and legislative agenda.",

        "title": "Combating Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic",
        "type": "Project",
        "content"  : "In 2003, the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) signed a cooperative agreement with DevTech to implement the Combating Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic project. The program works worked with the International Labor Organization, the Dominican Secretariats of Education and Labor, and other stakeholders to:Raise awareness of the importance of education for all children and to mobilize a wide array of actors to improve and expand education infrastructures;Strengthen formal and transitional education systems that encourage working children and those at risk of working to attend school;Strengthen national institutions and policies on education and child labor; andEnsure the long-term sustainability of these efforts.The Dominican Republic’s Secretariat of Labor defined the &quot;worst forms of child labor&quot; (WFCL) as hazardous work in agriculture, dangerous urban work in streets or sweatshops, domestic servants, child trafficking, and commercial sexual exploitation. When the Dominican Government ratified ILO Convention 182, it committed to take immediate and effective measures to eliminate the WFCL within 10 years. Within this framework, as well as the USDOL’s objectives, this project’s goal was to reduce the number of children involved in WFCL by 4,200—commercial sexual exploitation (450), informal urban economy (850), and dangerous agriculture (2,900)—over a four-year period. Targeted children included those who either dropped out of school or attended school irregularly, with the latter group repeating grades or ropping out of school altogether. About 5,600 children benefitted from this program.Project InterventionsThe Combating Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic project addressed three main areas: creating a complete educational program for &quot;the other shift,&quot; or the other half-day; making school more relevant and attractive by providing teachers and administrators with special training and supervision; and providing vocational education to adolescents who opted out of regular schooling.Espacios Para Crecer (&quot;Spaces for Growth&quot;)DevTech and its partners developed an education program to ensure regular school attendance bychildren in the 6-14 age group (the targed age range for the project). The project team created Espacios para Crecer (Spaces for Growth) – a high-quality, well-structured program with three basic components: academic leveling (focusing on math, reading, and writing), recreation (physical education, music, theater, art, and literature), and life skills.Attendance records indicated that over 95 percent of the targeted children attended both regular school and the Espacios para Crecer program daily, and were promoted both during and at the end of the school year. Teacher TrainingThe project also focused on the teachers of the targeted children. A three-day training course in Quantum Learning methodology was delivered to 500 educators and administrators.After the first training course to 160 educators (financed with project funds), the Dominican Secretariat of Education was so impressed that it financed courses for 240 teachers and administrators, while Plan International, an NGO, financed courses for 100 more teachers.Vocational EducationThe vocational training program targeting adolescents (14–17 years old) presented challenges since vocational education institutions in the Dominican Republic require a basic education (8th grade) certificate for admission and very few of the targeted adolescents had completed 8th grade.The project team identified several institutions that were willing to offer programs to these adolescents. For example, a private institution in Santiago trained 33 adolescents in pastry making, commercial sewing (tailoring), and basic computer skills. A private vocational school in Santo Domingo offered a special program for 80 adolescents during a six-week summer session. One rural school with a small computer lab provided computer skills training for adolescents in that community. In the beach community of Sosúa, 30 young women completed a six-month training course for beauty salon assistants. The project also adapted a program for micro-enterprise training that was taught to a group of adolescents and their parents in the beach community of Las Terrenas.SustainabilityTo ensure the sustainability of the program, DevTech and its partners created a consortium to continue the operation of existing EpCs and advance improvements in education. The consortium has become a strong network of Dominican and U.S.-based organizations and has received support from multiple sources, including the Dominican Secretariat of Education, among others.Also, the EpC program has been replicated by DevTech and other organizations in communities in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Colombia.In 2007, the EpC program and the activities of DevTech and its partners received additional funding (through 2011) from the U.S. Department of Labor.

This pioneering, evidence-based initiative was designed to reduce school-related gender-based violence (SRGBV), improve educational outcomes, and reduce negative health outcomes. Program interventions were implemented in schools in the two countries and focused on students ranging in age from approximately 10 to 14.DevTech was the prime contractor for this pilot project for USAID. In both countries, DevTech fully collaborated with civil society and community organizations to develop local capacity to design, implement, and monitor and evaluate SRGBV prevention interventions and their impact so that gender safety could become the norm in schools. The program also worked with stakeholders on the national and institutional level to provide training and raise awareness of SRGBV so that these actors could assist those on the community and individual levels. The final product of the Safe Schools program was a series of three global Doorways training manuals (students, community counselors, and teachers) and country-specific materials still in use. These materials were also translated into several different languages and are used in other countries across the globe.The Safe Schools project demonstrates the benefit of using evidence-based, collaborative approaches, as well as DevTech’s dedication to true capacity-building. DevTech is proud that other organizations are using these materials developed with American taxpayer money to reduce gender-based violence in schools.Save the Children, Plan International, and the Malawian YouthNet and Counselling (YONECO) are among several international organizations that have adopted and implemented the Safe Schools training materials to continue to address school violence in Malawi, and in programs in other countries, including Haiti and Senegal. In addition, USAID has translated the Safe Schools training materials into Arabic, Russian, French, and Spanish, and has posted them on its website.The manuals and other interventions have been used throughout the program at each of the following levels:Individual levelThe Doorways Student Training Manual utilizes a children’s rights approach and gender approach to teaching children about appropriate gender relations. Based on the results of the program endline survey, the piloting of the manual was successful at increasing students’ knowledge of, and changing their attitudes regarding, SRGBV. The classroom program was complemented with additional interventions such as theater for development, radio, gender clubs, after-school programs, and assemblies. An excellent example of the children applying what they learned can be viewed on a video entitled: Mister Speaker, Sir.Community levelThe Doorways Community Counselors Training Manual provides resources at the community level to identify and refer cases of school-related gender-based violence to service providers.Institutional levelThe Doorways Teachers Training Manual provides training for education professionals on SRGBV awareness, prevention, reporting, and referral. The program endline survey confirmed that after receiving the training, teachers had changed their attitudes about their role in preventing SRGBV and how to apply the Teachers’ Code of Conduct. In addition, improved and consolidated Codes of Conduct were developed in both pilot countries by the respective teachers’ unions and education ministries.National levelAn Advocates Network was formed to raise awareness of SRGBV among key stakeholders and government officials. Also, a series of campaign posters was developed in each country.PublicationsThe Safe Schools Program: Ghana Assessment ReportThe Safe Schools Program: Ethiopia Assessment ReportThe Safe Schools Program: Jamaica Assessment ReportThe Safe Schools Program: Malawi Assessment ReportThe Safe Schools Program: Quantitative Research Instrument to Measure School-Related Gender-Based ViolenceThe Safe Schools Program: Student and Teacher Baseline Report on School-Related Gender-Based Violence in Machinga District, MalawiThe Safe Schools Program: A Qualitative Study to Examine School-Related Gender-Based Violence in MalawiSafe Schools Program: Final Report",

        "content"  : "DevTech was the prime contractor on USAID’s Decentralization and Local Governance program in Guatemala. DevTech provided technical assistance in municipalities and coordinated assistance for national-level institutions to improve the capacity to support decentralization. In two cases, contract results were modified mid-course due to changes in Government of Guatemala requirements for municipalities. DevTech conducted the necessary technical analysis to adjust the program activities and re-target assistance. DevTech also helped the Governor of the San Marcos Department establish a system for municipalities to implement reconstruction activities and monitor reconstruction projects in the aftermath of Hurricane Stan.DevTech incorporated an integrated performance monitoring system for its work at the local government level, which includes indicators for more than 20 lower-level results, and data collection (baseline and yearly) in 15 municipalities. The system served as a basis for establishing indicators of municipal development and guided program activities.The Program had four Sub-Intermediate Results (IR):Sub-IR 2.1 More transparent systems for management of public resources by local governmentsSub-IR 2.2 Increased devolution of responsibilities and resources to the local level resulting in greater responsiveness by local governments to citizens’ needsSub-IR 2.3 More opportunities for citizen participation in and oversight of local government decision-makingSub-IR 2.4 Local capacity for the development and implementation of reconstruction program strengthened in the San Marcos Department.  Sub-IR 2.1. More Transparent Systems for Management of Public ResourcesThis Sub-IR indicator measured the improvement in the fiscal performance of the selected municipalities. For the 13 selected Program municipalities, intergovernmental transfers were, on average, 92 percent of total revenues in 2008. The annual rate of growth of own-source revenues for the 13 selected municipalities increased from -0.5 percent in 2005 to 41.2 percent in 2008. Technical assistance was delivered through three mechanisms:Updating the municipal fees schedules;Improving operating regulations and collection of fees for municipal services; andStrengthening policies to reduce the avoidance of the payment of municipal servicesIn addition to the improvement in revenue collection, the Program successfully strengthened the public financial management systems at the municipal level. These included a public procurement system, financial management system, auditing units, and internal controls. In the base year of 2005, the average score for the 13 municipalities was 31 out of 100 points. When the Program closed in September 2009, the average had increased to 89 out of 100 points.Sub-IR 2.2. Increased devolution of responsibilities and greater responsiveness to citizen needs The focus of the activities in this Sub-IR was to change the dynamics at the national level for decentralization. The Program:Developed a proposal for a municipal tax code and a municipal code;Introduced a solution for the problem of municipal debt;Designed a Single-Window for Municipal Projects as the mechanism to improve the coordination of national and municipal public investment; andProvided legal assistance for the revision of the statutes of national-level municipal associations to reform their reform its governance structure. Sub-IR 2.3. More opportunities for citizen participation in and oversight of local government decision-makingThe indicator for Sub-IR 2.3 was defined as: “Number of Municipalities with Municipal Development Council (COMUDE) Citizen Participation Commissions operating”. Although the target was seven (7) COMUDEs, by the end of the Program 10 COMUDEs had been established and were functioning with the appropriate commissions and committees. Those formed included the participation of municipal authorities and community leaders. These commissions monitored the commitments made by the COMUDE. In addition, the commissions were conceived as a space to improve the quality, not only the number, of women participating. The Program experience suggests that women participate more actively in small groups. Over the course of the four years of field implementation, a total of 22,744 persons participated in training workshops, COMUDEs, and Commissions (not exclusive to Citizen Participation). Of this total, 24.8 percent were women.Sub-IR 2.4. Local capacity for the development and implementation of reconstruction program strengthened in the San Marcos Department.At the request of USAID, Sub-IR 2.4 was added to the Program to contribute to the reconstruction process in the Department of San Marcos in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Stan. In the aftermath of Hurricane Stan, DevTech provided technical assistance during a two-year period to 14 municipalities as well as the governor’s office to track and manage rehabilitation projects to ensure their completion, and strengthen the Municipal Planning Offices and COMUDES to take a pro-active role in the process. A tangible outcome was the design of an easy-to-use management information system for monitoring infrastructure projects that can be used at the municipal levels. The Program has worked with the Secretariat of Decentralization (SCEP) to establish a one-stop window for processing municipal investment projects, and also worked with SCEP and Executive Secretariat of Planning and Programming to replicate the program as a model across the country.",

This grant is a direct reflection of the success of the DevTech project, Combating Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic, completed in 2007. In association with two Dominican organizations and a number of local subcontractors, DevTech built upon the successes of the last project and introduced new innovations to offer Dominican youth an alternative to exploitative child labor.This project aimed to prevent or withdraw 10,000 Dominican youths (7,500 children and 2,500 adolescents) from exploitative child labor by scaling up the educational models introduced in the first project and introducing new programs to provide educational alternatives to adolescents. Espacios Para Crecer (&quot;Spaces for Growth&quot;)A major component of this project was the continuation of the &quot;Espacios para Crecer&quot; (EpC) model introduced in the previous project. In the Dominican Republic, the overcrowding of schools necessitates a shift system where half of the students attend school during a morning shift, and half during an afternoon shift. The EpCs provide a second shift of non-formal education that complements the Dominican national curriculum. This project saw the opening of new EpCs in various regions throughout the Dominican Republic. The facilitators of these new EpCs received training in Quantum Learning® methodology. Funding provided by the United States Department of Labor under cooperative agreement E-9-K-3-0054 financed the development of the EpC materials.The Espacios Para Emprender (&quot;Spaces for Entrepreneurship&quot;) ModelThe cornerstone of this project was the introduction of a vocational training program geared toward adolescents. The goal of the &quot;Espacios para Emprender&quot; (EpEs) is to help out-of-school youth gain marketable skills through compensatory education programming. Specifically, volunteer facilitators who serve as counselors guide the adolescents toward vocational training programs based on their desired careers. The EpE program also provides job placement support to adolescents.",

Trainings enhanced accountants’ capacity to enter information into the TRRS and auditors’ capacity both in the AGF and AGO to perform real-time audits of government agencies, offices, aid Ministries.As part of this initiative, DevTech developed an organizational change management (OCM) strategy for the TRRS, and worked with other project team members to implement it.

At the time of the evaluation, the ALP was implemented in 10 counties by 11 implementing partners.The Evaluation Team dedicated three months in Liberia to assess:The coverage and impact of the USAID-funded ALPP intervention after 18 months of implementation; andThe relative efficacy and appropriateness of the overall ALP model for students aged 15 and older as implemented by the 11 partner agencies.The evaluation design included classroom observations, focus groups, and student testing.The Evaluation Team traveled to the six counties where ALPP was implemented, visiting a total of 18 school sites and covering the educational programs of the USAID-implemented ALPP, Partner-implemented ALPs, and MoE-run Conventional Primary School Grades 1-6. Data was collected through 39 classroom observations as well as focus groups/interviews that were carried out with a number of stakeholders, which included: Ministry of Education personnel, partner organizations, County and District Education Officers, principals, community members, Parent-Teacher Associations, youth groups and students.To assess the learning outcomes of ALP students and determine the overall effectiveness of the program, the Team developed and administered assessment instruments in Mathematics and Language Arts for ALP Levels II and III. The exams were designed to assess proficiency in specific skills such as subtraction, division, use of pronouns, and comprehension. To provide comparative data, the tests were also administered to students in MoE Grades 3 and 5 and to students in ALP partner programs. In total, 806 students were tested by the DevTech team.To complement the evaluation aspects of the assignment, DevTech delivered three capacity building workshops to staff of the implementing partners and other Liberian educators.

A key element of this initiative is USAID’s Evaluation Policy, released in January 2011.Meta-Evaluation QuestionsThe meta-evaluation on which this volume reports systematically examined 340 randomly selected evaluations and gathered qualitative data from USAID staff and evaluators to address three questions:1. To what degree have quality aspects of USAID’s evaluation reports, and underlying practices, changed over time?2. At this point in time, on which evaluation quality aspects or factors do USAID’s evaluation reports excel and where are they falling short?3.

The project evaluations looked at the high-level results as they related to each project’s objectives, and looked to inform new project implementation under the new five-year Country Development and Cooperation Strategy (CDCS), as well as heavily influence upcoming FtF and GCC strategy implementation.For the each project evaluation, DevTech and its partner, AMEX International, utilized the methods of document review, interviews, field visits, and a review of quantitative data. For the mid-term projects, this evaluation was able to demonstrate to USAID/Guatemala what is not working and why, provided recommendations to the Mission as to what should be adjusted or eliminated, and also made suggestions as to how to increase the sustainability for this project. For the end-of-project evaluations, the Team was able to provide USAID/Guatemala with information regarding the projects meeting their objectives, as well as recommendations on how future projects could meet the Mission’s Feed the Future Multi-year Strategy.

The paper’s central thesis was that a crisis existed in the educational systems of the countries of the region that adversely affected the human resource endowment of the societies. This phenomenon, comparable in terms of economic consequences to the destruction of the rain forest, had far-reaching implications for the economic and social development prospects of the region. In its discussion of the educational crisis, the paper addressed financial constraints, the dilemma of quality versus coverage, and dependence on external financial resources. Reform was suggested on the following fronts: priority of educational policy, institutional reform of education ministries, improved teacher salaries, decentralized administrative functions, and increased effectiveness and sustainability of international assistance.",
