      "content"	 : "DevTech improved access and quality of education in multicultural, multilingual, remote communities of the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua through CARS.DevTech Systems, Inc. implemented the Community Action for Reading and Security (CARS) Activity, funded by USAID, in eight municipalities of the Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast. The Activity was implemented from September 27, 2013 to February 28, 2020, with the objective of improving early grade reading performance in students from 1st to 3rd grade of primary and contribute to reduce citizen insecurity in the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua. This is the first of a series of three Blogs that highlight how DevTech ensured that the CARS Activity achieved the objectives established with USAID. The second blog will address how CARS contributed to improve citizen security and the third blog will highlight how DevTech developed and strengthened local capacity among Nicaraguan Non-Governmental Organizations and Universities.The Caribbean Coast is recognized by its ethnic and cultural diversity, as well as the prevalence of various languages spoken by minority groups. The 2014 household survey (EMNV) data shows that 7.4% of the Nicaraguan population are identified as part of an ethnic group, 75.2% are from the Caribbean Coast. The Caribbean Coast educational conditions present greater challenges than the rest of the national territory. For example, the EMNV 2014 data also shows that the average years of schooling are 5.9 for the Caribbean Coast and 7.0 for the Country; there is 11.4% of illiterate population in the Caribbean Coast, while the Country average is 6.26%. Data from the 2014 CARS baseline showed that, at that moment, 30% of teachers did not have Teaching and Learning Materials (TLM) to prepare their classes, and 70% of teachers affirmed that their students did not have textbooks either.These conditions affected reading fluency performance. The 2014 Baseline assessment found that only 5.3% of first grade students were able to read with fluency in Spanish. In order to mitigate the needs of the educational community, DevTech purchased and distributed more than 139,000 teaching and reading materials. Materials included textbooks to practice reading at school and at home; fungible materials along with training on how to effectively use them to improve classroom setting; teacher guides for educators with examples and exercises to apply in the classrooms. DevTech also provided teacher training and bimonthly coaching on innovative strategies and methodologies to improve reading fluency, with more than 1,600 teachers.One core component of DevTech’s approach was the implementation of the Espacios para Crecer (Spaces for Growth) EpCs. DevTech’s EpC program intervention was organized in the regions to support and complement the regular school curriculum and provide activities for healthy holistic development of personal, social and academic skills. EpCs are implemented with community buy-in and held in spaces provided by the local communities, such as town halls, churches, local businesses, homes and even in schools. Facilitators, many of whom are teachers, lead EpCs. The program is based in Quantum Learning® methodology, which uses the senses (sight, sound, touch, smell and psychomotor) to create a more dynamic learning experience. The material covered in the EpCs was developed and contextualized to the local context of the Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast to compliment the national curriculum and uses music, theater, art, physical education and literature to enhance learning. Participants are kept away from manifestations of risk, insecurity, abuse, violence and violation of their legal rights. Children not in school are reinserted as successful participants in regular schooling. Children learn the importance of education in assuring their growth as citizens and positive contributors to society. Through awareness raising activities, parents, community members and leaders become responsible for and participated in the development of the EpC participants. The external evaluation led by Mathematica Policy Research found that the EpC program had a positive impact in medium-remote communities on children’s decoding ability, equivalent to 13.12% compared to the control group. Children in the treatment group were able to correctly read two more invented words (pseudo-words) in one minute than students in the control group were. Children in the treatment group correctly read an average of 18 invented words in one minute, whereas children in the control group read an average of 16 invented words. EpC also had a positive impact on children’s reading fluency, equivalent to 12% more than the control group. The average child in the control group was able to read 37 words per minute, and in the treatment group, the average child could read 41 words per minute. Lastly, EpC had positive impacts on reading comprehension.CARS Review 3.PNGEpCs are a DevTech product inspired by Quantum Learning. The program was originally financed by the USDOL. We have worked with partners in an array of countries to revise, contextualize, and adapt the program. We developed the program in the Dominican Republic (2007-2011) where EpCs are still being implemented with USAID funding and active private sector and community support. In addition, we have implemented EpCs with CARE in Central America and with Partners of the Americas in Colombia, Ecuador and Panama. DevTech considers the program implementation in Nicaragua as highly successful, despite the implementation challenges in the region, and can serve as a starting point for future educational interventions in the Caribbean Coast of NicaraguaLearn more about the CARS project here.",

      "content"	 : "Earlier this month, DevTech staff Dr. Oleksandr Rohozynsky and Ms. Marisa Acierno teamed up with local consultants across Kenya and Tanzania to collect data for an impact evaluation of the U.S. Department of State countering violent extremism (CVE) portfolio in East Africa. These efforts comprised the third and final round of data collection, representing the culmination of a three-year, multi-stage quasi-experimental impact evaluation. The evaluation team collected data across fourteen outcome-level indicators to answer the following question: Do counties that receive CVE assistance experience a reduction on violent extremism (VE) drivers over time compared to counties that do not receive support?The evaluation team identified individuals and groups who could speak knowledgeably about local issues in relation to those fourteen indicators, which encompass topics relating to socio-economic opportunity and marginalization, political marginalization, ethnic tensions, and security. Youth, professionals, men and women, civil society organizers, local government officials, male and female elders, and local police and security forces were invited to take part in focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs). The team conducted nearly 30 FGDs and KIIs across Kenya and Tanzania. These findings will be rigorously analyzed to provide rich context and add important nuance to the results of a complementary quantitative survey that reached over 1,600 people in eight counties in Kenya and Tanzania. DevTech looks forward to preparing the final report and presenting our findings to the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations at the U.S. Department of State next month!Dr. Oleksandr Rohozynsky (far right) and local consultant Lucy Waithaka meet with local community leaders in Nairobi, Kenya.A moment of levity during a focus group discussion with youth in Nairobi, Kenya.",

      "content"	 : "On January 22, 2020, the Community Action for Reading and Security (CARS) activity held a one-day Forum in Managua entitled “Best practices and lessons learned on classroom observation and reading performance assessment on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua.” Ninety-six participants attended including USAID representatives, CARS grantees, beneficiaries and education experts. Distinguished guests in attendance included Nora Pinzon, USAID Program Office Director; Alicia Slate, CARS Contract Officer Representative; Dr. Randy Hatfield, Director of DevTech’s Education, Gender and Youth Practice and representatives from the World Bank, Save the Children, World Vision, UNICEF and Project Concern International.  USAID’s Nora Pinzon commented that:“The CARS activity has contributed to improving the quality of education of more than 26,000 students of the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua. It has provided around 139,000 reading materials and trained more than 1,200 teachers creating awareness in remote rural communities about the importance of literacy, safety, and security for their children”.During the Forum, participants had the opportunity to hear from Dr. Vanessa Castro Cardenal, Early Grade Reading Specialist and Inter-American Development Bank Researcher on the difficulties of teaching literacy in a multicultural context, and from Miguel Núñez, CARS DCOP, on the results obtained by the CARS activity. Stands were set-up to showcase the work on Spaces for Growth (Espacios para Crecer) and the formal reading program, where participants were able to ask questions, review materials and interact with CARS staff involved in the implementation of those activities.The Forum also engaged panels on topics such as intercultural and bilingual education and best practices and lessons learned from grantees in the implementation of the project. Alicia Slate, USAID Education Specialist and CARS COR participated as an expert on the panel “Importance of Intercultural Bilingual Education for the Early Grade Reading in the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua.”The event culminated with recognition of organizations that were instrumental to the implementation of the CARS project, including Fundación Hermanamiento RaMa, Fundación MARIJN, Fundación Zamora Terán and the two local universities URACCAN and BICU.

      "title": "Venezuela is dollarizing, but still in crisis",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "The Venezuelan crisis has reached a new stage: after prolonged hyperinflation and due to the total distrust of the fiscal and monetary authorities, the Venezuelan public is using the US dollar for daily transactions. According to market analysts, the share of transactions made in U.S. dollars reached 54% of all sales in the country during October. The lifting of exchange controls in Venezuela together with some companies’ decisions to pay workers in foreign currency and inflows of remittances from abroad have made this dollarization possible.In a surprising move, socialist leader Nicolás Maduro said in a television interview on November 17 that the informal dollarization process “can be used for recovery … it is an escape valve (which contributes to the) recovery and deployment of the productive forces (of the Venezuelan economy),” although he also mentioned that the bolivar will continue to be Venezuela’s legal currency. (See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= vQT8srugE1A.) These remarks stand in stark contradiction to Maduro’s policies since rising to power in 2013.Informal dollarization has also given way to opportunities for consumers to access both basic consumer goods and other goods for the Christmas holidays. On November 29, some stores in the cities of Caracas, Maracaibo in the northwest, and Barquisimeto (centre-west) held “Black Friday” sales with discounts of up to 80% in an attempt to reactivate demand for consumer goods, which has fallen by more than 50% so far in 2019. Despite the sales, products offered in Venezuela remain far more expensive than those offered by the US market.PDVSA and the Maduro regime offer Yuan payments to suppliersWhile the Venezuelan public increasingly relies on the U.S. dollar, the socialist regime and its state oil company PDVSA have reportedly turned the yuan, given the impossibility of accessing financing in US dollars as a result of sanctions by the United States Treasury Department. At least four providers of services to the public sector report receiving payments in yuan in recent months. Administrative procedures involving China are more expensive for Venezuela, because the Constitution requires documentation certified by the National Assembly in order to open a bank account. It has also been reported that several state entities (including PDVSA) have made cash payments in euros, the proceeds of questionable sales of gold and oil by the Maduro regime.ConocoPhillips legal fight continues for Citgo assetsDespite the embargo by the US, on November 26, the US company ConocoPhillips filed a motion in federal court in the state of Delaware seeking to seize shares of Citgo, a subsidiary of the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA in the United States, to serve as compensation for the expropriation of assets in 2007. Last year the International Chamber of Commerce awarded ConocoPhillips $2 billion, but PDVSA has made only partial payment.The United States imposes new sanctions on Venezuelan ships bound for CubaThis week the United States government identified six vessels owned by the state-owned oil company PDVSA as blocked property. The vessels had been carrying clandestine shipments of crude oil destined for Cuba in exchange for Cuba’s assistance with security and intelligence. Cuba has been Venezuela’s main ideological ally since the Chávez regime and has continued to be Maduro’s main international support.According to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Venezuela also sneaked around 1,300,000 barrels of fuel oil to Cuba earlier in 2019. The resulting money was transferred to a bank account of Russian origin.",

      "content"	 : "In a recent Wall Street Journal article, The Secret Power of the Children’s Picture book, the author highlights how early experiences reading picture books with caregivers supports children’s cognitive, oral language and vocabulary development, thereby laying the foundation for subsequent development. In contrast to both purely listening to a story without any visualizations, which is too little to support young children’s sustained attention, and watching animations, which stimulates their brain too much to enable them to interact with the content, research suggests that reading picture books provides young learners with a “just right” amount of neural stimulation to positively contribute to their development (1).An Early Childhood Education teacher reading a picture book to learners in Eastern Province, Zambia. Photo taken with consent.The results of the baseline 2018 Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA), administered by USAID Education Data activity to over 15,000 Grade 2 learners in five target provinces in Zambia also underscores the importance of reading with parents and other caregivers for literacy skills development. Learners who reported that someone reads to them at home, were on average able to read 6.59 more correct words per minute than learners who were not read to at home. However, only 7 percent reported that they were read to everyday and more than one in three learners reported that they are never read to at home.The infrequent occurrence of reading at home is likely in part due to a lack of access to print materials in many of Zambia’s rural and remote communities. Only 41 percent of learners reported that they had access to reading materials at home and only 14 percent of primary schools in the five target provinces had libraries. However, learners who did attend schools with libraries on average read 7.2 more correct words per minute than learners in schools without a library, which suggests their important contribution to learning outcomes.The baseline EGRA results highlight the on-going need for innovative approaches that allow for the development and distribution of children’s books at scale to ensure that globally, there is at least one book in every caregiver’s hand to enable them to provide the “just right” amount of stimulation to support their children’s development.Source:  Gurdon, M.C., (2019).

      "title": "The Venezuelan economy continues in free fall",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Last year, in August and September 2018, socialist leader Nicolás Maduro launched the Economic Recovery, Growth and Prosperity Plan of Venezuela. The Plan’s most significant policies were a monetary reconversion (removing five zeroes form the currency to create the “Sovereign Bolivar”); a salary increase, for which the regime promised to cover the salary differential of small and medium enterprises within 90 days; a savings plan based on the sale of gold and silver bullion to the general public; and the restoration of exchange operations between banks. The plan was to intended to stabilize prices and reactivate the productive apparatus of Venezuela, which at that time already had fallen 36.9% between 2013 and 2017, while experience inflation of 10,025.5% over the same period(1).Now, more than a year after the plan’s introduction, the Venezuelan economy does not show signs of recovery. Although the hyperinflationary process has slowed down (inflation in September was 23.5%, a steep decline from August’s inflation of 65.2%) (2),  economic activity has continued to decline, now registering a drop of 49.3% since 2013(3). This result is mostly explained by declines in the construction sector (52.3%), financial and insurance institutions (45.2%), and the manufacturing sector (39.3%). Regarding aggregate demand, fixed gross investment in Venezuela fell by 64.8% compared to 2017; while private consumption expenditure and government consumption expenditure declined at rates of 9.1% and 20.1%, respectively.Gross domestic product continues to declineFor the first quarter of 2019, the Venezuelan economy registered a decrease of 26.8% compared to the same period of 2018. The construction sector was the most affected, with a decrease of 74.1%, followed by the manufacturing sector (56.3%), and then by the social service provider sector with a drop of 47.4%. Among the reasons for this poor economic performance are the difficulties in accessing internal financing due to the strict marginal reserve requirement, delays in the allocation of foreign exchange, and the negative expectations of the private sector regarding the short- and medium-term economic outlook (4).Figure 1. Quarterly YoY Real GDP Growth and the Potential GDP of Venezuela (%)Source: BCV, own calculationsThe long term trend (potential) Venezuelan growth has also fallen significantly, falling for 25 consecutive quarters, a cumulative drop of 52.9% since the fourth quarter of 2014. To recover the levels of growth achieved in 2013, the Venezuelan economy would need to grow at a rate of 1.6% for 43 consecutive years.Imports, net oil exports, and external assetsImports registered an annualized decrease of 12.6% in the first quarter of 2019. This is due to declining oil imports, which after four consecutive quarters of annualized growth recorded a 23% decrease for the first three months of 2019. Since January 2019 the United States has imposed sanctions on PDVSDA prohibiting the importing of oil and oil-derived products for the refining of crude oil and production gasolineFigure 2. Imports (US$ Million)Source: BCV, own calculationsNet exports of oil have experienced a progressive decline since the third quarter of 2012, when one of Venezuela’s most important refineries experienced collapsed, causing more than 40 deaths, 120 injuries, and substantial material losses. Since then Venezuelan oil production has also been affected by blackouts and electrical rations due to droughts, attrition of personnel due to poor working conditions, non-payment to transport service providers, and US sanctions, falling by approximately 72.4% between September 2012 and September 2019(5).Figure 3. Net oil exports (US$ Millions)Source: BCV, own calculationsInternational reserves stood at US$8,234 million in the first quarter of 2019, which represents a decrease of 7% compared to the end of 2018. Reserves in monetary gold were US$4,751, a decrease of 219% since the same period in 2014, the result of the sale of gold by the Maduro regime to obtain financing due to the impossibility of accessing international markets(6).Figure 4.

      "content"	 : "Through its Community Action for Reading and Security (CARS) Activity, DevTech has increased efforts to improve the assessment of early grade reading. The CARS Activity has introduced the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) methodology to the Caribbean Coast and in doing so has strengthened the capacities of both Bluefields Indian and Caribbean University (BICU) and Universidad de las Regiones Autónomas de la Costa Caribe Nicaragüense (URACCAN) to evaluate learner outcomes. Recently university staff from both BICU and URACCAN conducted the endline EGRA to assess students served by the CARS Activity in eight municipalities of the Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast. In Nicaragua, twenty-one percent of Grade 1 students repeat the year or drop out of school all together because they are not able to master core early grade reading skills. As a result, improving reading performance in the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua is a challenge. Over the last 4 years, more than 130 people, of which more than 60 percent are women, have been trained in how to conduct and use EGRAs to assess students’ performance in reading skills. In comparison to the traditional reading exercise, where teachers correct students as they read individual words, EGRA provides more rigorous data on students’ abilities in foundational reading skills such as letter sound knowledge and decoding that are building blocks for later success in reading. Under the CARS Activity, learners from first to third grade in multilingual and multicultural contexts were assessed. The EGRA was administered in Spanish and Miskitu, yielding reading analyses and feedback to teachers and other stakeholders to enhance the reading ability of indigenous, afro-descendant, and mestizo children. The results are being used both to assess the Activity’s impact on Early Grade Reading Performance and to influence evidence-based policies for the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua.Local university staff, applying Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA), to third grader of Rafaela Herrera Primary school, October 2019, Kahkabila, RACCS.

      "content"	 : "Zambia continues to place high importance on learning achievement.  To help the Ministry of General Education (MOGE) monitor the progress of Zambian early grade readers, DevTech is partnering with the Examinations Council of Zambia (ECZ) to implement the USAID funded Education Data activity. The key project outputs include the management of two, large-scale, early grade reading assessments (EGRAs). A baseline was conducted in 2018 and a midline is expected in 2020 in five target provinces to understand the reading ability of Grade 2 learners where another USAID funded project “Let’s Read” is being implemented.The USAID Education Data activity not only conducts assessments to understand learning achievement but also fosters learning within ECZ to transfer greater technical oversight to its staff to deliver a midline EGRA and future assessments. How is this being achieved?  Between July and December 2018, the Education Data activity carried out a capacity assessment of existing staff at ECZ to determine human resource gaps where skills training would be required. Based on the results of this assessment and in close partnership with ECZ, five skills workshops were designed to strengthen the capacity in ten distinct skills which are essential for conducting large-scale EGRAs.The first of the series of skills training workshops was conducted and is demonstrating hope for promoting stronger local capacity on the path to self-reliance. The Education Data activity facilitated a 7-day hands-on skills development workshop in psychometrics and test equating for seven participants of the ECZ research unit.Workshop participants shared their reflections on “learning”:      Good learning experience. I work on test development and research. Now I have an opportunity and need to read so that I learn more.        It has been very educational. I am a person responsible for test development. I heard about terms like “item discrimination” and “item difficulty.” During this workshop I now know how these terms are used. The course has been an eye opener but I need more time to practice.        The workshop has been very engaging and useful!        It has been very challenging as well as supportive and educational!        The training has come at the right time. I am a master’s student in research and this workshop has helped a lot. … I need to read and practice.        Three days have been interactive. The pace of the workshop was accommodating. I enjoy statistics and the training has helped us to explain assessment scores. I’m now confident to handle tasks of this nature. A lot of information was given!        From baseline to this skills training workshop our relationship is growing and there is a lot that we need to learn and do together until we successfully complete the midline survey. *  As part of the midline EGRA, ECZ alongside Education Data activity staff will apply the skills developed as part of this workshop to ensure that there are reliable, valid, and equitable relationships between the baseline and midline score scales.You can read more about the Zambia Education Data Activity here.",

      "title": "The MEL Activity and Field Based Monitoring",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "In September 2016, USAID/Nigeria awarded DevTech Systems, Inc. the four-year Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Activity (MEL). This contract aims to make USAID/Nigeria the premier practitioner in Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) and Collaborating, Learning and Adapting (CLA). Out of the work of the MEL Activity, one of the main components and focus on the second half of the Activity is Field Based Monitoring (FBM).**Background **Traditional Third-Party Monitoring (TPM) – process of sampling and collecting monitoring data through field monitors and/or TPM data collection firms and conducting quality assurance to ensure reliable reporting to USAID. This has been conducted for years now in places like Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq, in order to gather data in areas where USAID personnel are not permitted to travel.Map of States of Nigeria by RSO designated ZoneThe MEL Activity’s FBM platform pairs local knowledge with collection technology to analyze data and develop monitoring reports that give USAID/Nigeria greater insight to the success and challenges of their activities in hard to reach. The MEL Activity deploys FBM as not only for data collection, but as a project management tool used to collect and collate activity or project level information and verify field implementation in difficult to access areas, built on the lessons learned and experiences in other nonpermissive environments. We assist USAID Nigeria in evaluating programmatic assumptions and providing a better understanding of Nigeria’s operational context through providing near-real time information on hard to reach areas.ProcessFBM verifies field implementation in difficult to access areas beginning with geographic areas identified as Level 3 and Level 4 by the Regional Security Officer (see Figure 1), along with high priority Mission Activities, as determined by MEL and it’s Contracting Officer Representative (COR), in coordination with the Program and Front Offices. Requests will come in from the USAID Nigeria Mission, followed by a planning session with MEL Staff and USAID Nigeria to determine which of the third-party firms is most appropriate for this assessment. A detailed planning with meeting is also held with the Implementing Partner (IP) upon arrival in the field. Once the monitors are in the field, the MEL FBM Coordinator serves as the information pivot point, ensuring the schedule is executed accurately, tracking all security and/or other incidents that cause an adjustment to the initial schedule, and tracking incoming reports. They are also responsible for following up with reports that are not received in line with the schedule.As part of the assessment photos are taken of the sites including: with respondents, during observation and while the field monitors fill out the surveys. These photos are helpful for later when the firm has to write a summary report based on their field work. Once MEL receives a report from the field, the FBM Coordinator works with the MEL Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) Specialists who review incoming reports (specific to their assigned technical office) and carry out the data quality assurance process to finalize the report.Once finalized by MEL, the FBM Coordinator solicits the IP’s feedback on the report providing a specific timeline on which the IP must submit comments and/or its requested corrections to the report. MEL will add these comments verbatim into the Annex of the report and make changes to the report at the discretion of the MEL M&amp;amp;E Specialists. After the IP feedback period is concluded (or not if not received), MEL will submit the report to the USAID Agreement Officer’s Representative/COR to “reject/accept”. The specific format for and contents of the site visit report template have also been created, along with an FMB checklist.It is important to stress that, like data quality assessments, third party monitoring is not an audit, but rather an opportunity for the IPs to report any challenges or limitations they are facing, context and implementation constraints, and to identify capacity building challenges that MEL may be able to fill, if deemed appropriate.Data Sources MEL employs a modified utilization-focused approach with the goal in mind of strengthening the data that USAID employs to support decision-making and future programming. MEL focuses on what information the Mission wants to know, and keeps stakeholders involved in the process. In some cases, the data being collected is the same the IP would report on, in others, the inquiry is what the Mission wants to take a deeper look at.Field monitor entering data into AskiaFace mobile app while interviewing an NFLC facilitator at Dikwa LGA. Photo Credit: Masta ModuPrimary data sources utilized include –      Key Informant Interviews – face to face interviews between field monitors and people at the site        Focus Group Discussions- with a sample of IP activity beneficiaries        Field Monitor Observations – what the members of the firms are able to observe while at the IP’s Activity site        Digitally Produced Data – photos, GPS readings  Other secondary data sources utilized include: IP submitted source data such as annual reports, quarterly reports, our FBM protocols, and trackers and data sets provided.The data collection process is a relatively straightforward one. Field data are entered into the mobile application (AskiaFace mobile), and the data is uploaded and received immediately (or as soon as the enumerator is back in network range). Quantitative data collected are coded where counts and frequencies were used for measurement, and qualitative data are translated and transcribed from the original language to English. Finally, there are three levels of data validation to ensure the highest quality data are reported – level one performed by the field monitors themselves, level two by the MEL Activity Specialists, and level three by the MEL Activity COP.The data collection firms chosen for this work are experienced working in their often difficult geographic regions and, more importantly, are well versed in their technical area and they have demonstrated experience utilizing both verbal and written social science skills. We chose the Askia software suite based on scalability and ease of information upload while in the field.  This software allows us to: script our own tools, design our own surveys, conduct the surveys on mobile devices, upload survey data, and quickly and easily analyze the results. Firms’ members have their own phones, and the MEL Activity advises that there’s no marking on the front or back of the phone. Firms’ enumerators can just delete the app if need be for security purposesChallengesMEL’s Field Based Monitoring program has been highly successful in furthering the work of the activity, but it has still been challenging . Some of the biggest challenges identified from the pilot program and beyond include:  Communications: Ensuring that scheduled site visits are communicated to the AOR/COR and IPs at least a week in advance to allow proper time for preparations. To promote this, the MEL team  developed an email template to the AOR/COR along with a form letter addressed to the Chief of Party that identifies key information to help expedite the process.  GIS Consistency: GIS coordinates were not uniformly collected, and a GIS plan was not part of our pilot plan. To resolve this, the MEL Senior GIS Specialist added coordinates guidance to our site visit reporting template and started including a question that notes the specific geo-located information that the Technical Office wants the team to collect on our site visit preparation checklist  Reporting: The reporting and review timeframes for each FBM firm varied greatly. To mitigate that, we’ve conducted after action reviews providing feedback via the site visit template and verbally to each of the pilot firms.  Visuals: The MEL team was receiving pictures of varied quality based on the FMB firm. To combat this, the MEL Activity added a discussion and overview of the USAID Graphics Standards Manual and the USAID Shooting Guide to the 4-day FMB training.**Future Outlook **As of July 2019 , it is estimated that we will complete a minimum of 10 site visits per month to reach an annual total of 120 site visits through the activity in FY2019. The FBM data collection firms will also receive additional refresher training as the activity moves into it’s final year.",

      "content"	 : "SIMS IP Mtg.JPGSince 2016, DevTech’s S4SIPMS project has supported PEPFAR’s commitment to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by implementing hundreds of Site Improvement through Monitoring Systems (SIMS) site assessments across Nigeria. On Wednesday July 31st 2019 DevTech conducted the quarterly meeting with all USAID implementing partners that receive  PEPFAR funds to discuss their performance for quarters 2 and 3.  In alignment with DevTech’s culture of collaborating, learning and adapting (CLA) we used to this opportunity to not only highlight areas where IP’s are excelling or in need of remediation, but to foster conversation with and among the IPs to discuss the challenges they are facing and how they are overcoming them.  In our analysis of the data, we found that the reoccurring issue most IPs faced were poor waste management, stockouts primarily of HIV test kits, and some sites are not complying with the national HIV testing algorithm. By virtue of working in the same geographic regions, many of the IPs patients are from the same demographic and therefore share many of the same challenges.  To take advantage of the overlapping experiences and knowledge in the room, we had two IPs collaborate and draft a remediation plan for how they would improve their scores the following quarter.  Each plan went into detail describing their barriers and the internal procedures in place to ensure common practices such as following the testing and waste management protocols were being adhered to.  It was apparent by the tone of the dialog that all the IPs are serious about improving the quality  of the HIV / AIDS services and more importantly are working hard to see Nigeria reach epidemic control by 2030, on target with the UNAIDS goal.",

      "content"	 : "Traditional monitoring and its limitationsTraditional monitoring activities chart a project’s adherence to a pre-determined workplan. Success is considered completing all planned activities and deliverables. If we’re doing the work as planned, we are on the way to achieving our development objectives!However, this assumption—that adherence to the workplan equates to progress toward the objective—hinges on a critical factor: that the workplan and the objective are appropriately aligned.For some projects, this is a safe assumption to make. Previous programming in the region and deep contextual knowledge contribute to our confidence that planned activities will indeed contribute positively to our development goals. However, in new program areas or in transitioning environments, for example, we may not have access to this depth of contextual understanding prior to an intervention. And even in areas where we enjoy prior knowledge and rich networks, unforeseen changes on the ground can alter the needs of program beneficiaries in a way that challenges the program’s underlying logic, or theory of change. While the risk of assuming the workplan and the development objective are aligned is more apparent in certain programming contexts, that risk is present in every development project we undertake.Minimizing RiskAdaptive management is an approach, quickly gaining traction, that can mitigate the risk that activities and development objectives are unaligned. Adaptive management is a multi-faceted approach, but one principle tenant is to use MEL activities to enable strategic adaptation during implementation(1). During the design stage, teams identify weak points in the theory of change, determine what data is needed to verify those points, and locate appropriate data sources. Project staff should actively seek feedback from critical stakeholders and apply that feedback during the project re-design process. By strategically collecting focused information, triangulating findings against other data sources, and applying those learnings, we can see in real time whether a project is likely to produce the anticipated results or whether adjustments are needed.Building Capacity for MELThe adaptive management approach requires expert technical skills in monitoring and evaluation, data collection, data quality, and analysis. Adaptive management must be predicated by dedicated and focused training to enable project staff to develop the specific MEL skills required to successfully implement the adaptive management approach. DevTech Systems, Inc. is pleased to contribute to these efforts by building the MEL capacity of staff at USAID and its implementing partners through S4SIPMS and the Nigeria MEL Platform, among many others.Source:(1) Read more about how MEL informs adaptive management in ODI’s briefing paper “Making adaptive rigor work: principles and practices for strengthening monitoring, evaluation and learning for adaptive management”.ODI Briefing PaperMaking adaptive rigour work: Principles and practices for strengthening monitoring, evaluation and learning for adaptive managementBen Ramalingam, Leni Wild, Anne L.

The prior reporting system, PRS, will be disabled so that IPs and Mission staff can enter data into the new system. USAID will host a launch event on July 17th and July 19th to celebrate Monitor’s launch.Figure 1 USAID Nigeria Monitor Home PageNew features and enhancements from this system include, new ArcGIS maps where one can locate project and activities on an interactive map of Nigeria, a new dashboard to view activity performance, enhanced indicator comparison by activity tables, an enhanced way to view Performance Plan and Report (PPR) indicators and review documents in the Monitor library. For example, Figure 2 below shows the Maps Module in Monitor that lets you select different base layers to display such as streets, topographic, terrain, etc. Eventually we will be able to display Activity level data along with the base layers. The new system is sleek and designed to be user friendly, however if there are questions or requests, the site has a downloadable user manual as well as the ability to contact the help desk to assist USAID and IP staff with questions.Figure 2 Map Module in MonitorThe MEL Activity has been developing the platform since the start of the contract in 2016, with impressive strides made in the last year.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) noted in its latest report that Venezuelan oil production fell by 4.5% compared to last April to 741,000 barrels per day (a decrease of nearly 40% with respect to December 2018). The internal problems in the refineries, together with the sharp drop in oil imports from the United States (especially of diluents for the production of gasoline) have been the main reasons for the decrease.Faced with the difficulty of acquiring imported light crude to mix, the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA will stop producing improvable crude oil exported to the US market and focus instead on its customers in Asia, especially China. The company Petropiar, a joint venture between PDVSA and Chevron and located in the north-eastern state of Anzoátegui, will be dedicated from July on to blending heavy, light and extra heavy crude oils to produce Merey crude, a grade of heavy crude oil whose price is used as a reference for the international market.For its part, the industrial trade union CONINDUSTRIA reported in its qualitative for the first quarter of 2019 that the operational capacity of the industrial sector stood at 18%, a decrease of five percentage points compared to the last quarter of 2018.

      "content"	 : "A big challenge in education is not only teaching children how to read – it’s getting them to enjoy it too! Their appreciation of reading will expand their minds and take them to many places. Building these skills is particularly important in communities where opportunities are scarce and the reality is painted with multiple social problems.It is crucial to develop these skills at early stages of life. Therefore, DevTech, through its CARS Activity implemented with funding from USAID on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua, is using children’s story writing as a means to improve reading, writing and comprehension skills of girls and boys from first to third grade in eight municipalities. This will allow them to better communicate, advocate, and interpret their constant interactions with the world.Every year since 2015, DevTech has organized story contests to reinforce basic reading skills, to reflect on a given topic, and to engage parents or caregivers in their children’s educational process. Throughout the years, indigenous, Afro-descendants, and mestizo girls and boys ages 6 through 8 actively participated of the writing contest. From 2015 to 2018, the creative and enthusiastically young writers have produced over 270 stories - sending their imagination soaring, as they narrate about values, dreams, and access to new opportunities through reading.Jamal Christopher Hodgson, a 9-year-old Afro-descendant, is one of the young writers who participated in 2018. He excelled with his story entitled “Un personaje llamado Gladston” in which he narrates a story about a famous street vendor from the city of Bluefields, who by example fuelled entrepreneurship among the youth of that city. Jamal not only showcased his skills, but also shared his love for writing.On June 19, 2019, DevTech organized a second celebration for young writers like Jamal. USAID/Nicaragua Mission Director Ted Gehr participated in this event. He handed out certificates to these young writers, as well as a copy of the book “Stories and Narrations of the Multicultural Children of the Southern Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua”, which includes all stories written by them. The event was well attended by more than 100 children, parents, teachers, school directors and partner organizations.DevTech has implemented different strategies and methodologies that strengthen reading and writing skills of these students. It has also trained teachers, equipped schools with educational materials, supported community development for safer schools, and provided institutional strengthening to local non-governmental organizations (NGOs). To date, DevTech has reached 26,133 students, trained 1,683 teachers, and delivered over a hundred thousand educational materials, including story books and teachers guides.",

In pursuit of collecting evidence, DevTech implemented Zambia Education Data activity, forged rivers, camped in forests and crossed sand dunes in five different provinces in November 2018 to assess the reading skills of over 15,000 Grade 2 learners from 816 schools.  Results from the assessments, which were conducted in seven different languages, are intended to provide actionable recommendations to the Ministry of General Education and USAID/Zambia to inform policies and programs that aim to improve reading skills in Zambia.Crossing rivers…. In the remote and rural Senanga District in the Western Province, most people earn their livelihoods through fishing in local rivers, cultivating cassava and maize alongside raising goats, chickens and cows. Every morning and afternoon, children walk up to 20 kilometers across flooded plains to attend Lilunga Primary School. Education Data activity assessors experienced firsthand the obstacles children face, and the perseverance required for them to obtain basic education.  In November, the Zambezi river floods the plains preventing motor vehicles from passing through. Without transportation, the DevTech data collection team set out on foot before dawn to trek the 14 kilometers over 6 hours to reach the school to assess 20 learners.  Situated on a small sandy patch, volunteer teachers deliver instruction to learners in Grade 1 through 7 within the precariously built and supported structure.Crossing sand dunes and forests … Over 130 kilometers away, another data collection team, set out across sandy plains from the District Education Board’s office to reach Mbomo Primary school. Due to the difficult terrain, the only two suitable modes of transport are 4x4 all wheel vehicles and Oxcarts. While en route inside Sibala Forest, their vehicle broke down. As soon as they pulled over, the driver hurriedly ran off in search of the spare part needed, while the data collection team had no option but to prepare to camp for the night. Fortunately, with a tent, a fire to keep warm and some spare provisions the team made it through the night with most of their humor intact. With some luck, the driver was able to fix the vehicle and the team set off early the next morning towards Mboma. By lunch, the team arrived and eagerly began to assess the Grade 2 learners.Budget constraints and remoteness can lead to the exclusion of hard to reach schools and communities like Senanga and Mboma. Oftentimes they lack access to vital educational inputs such as instructional materials, teacher training and coaching, which urban schools more readily can access.  To provide Zambian policymakers with a complete picture of the lived experiences of the learners, teachers, and headteachers in these rural communities, DevTech is proud to cross rivers, sand dunes and to camp in forests to collect evidence.",

      "content"	 : "The problem of the commons (also called the tragedy of the commons) refers to a situation where a shared public resource, for example the “office refrigerator,” can be over-used because each individual user of the field maximizes his or her benefit without fully taking into account the impact on the shared resource to other users. If one user makes a mess or brings pungent food, he or she does not necessarily feel the full impact on other users. Examples of such negative externalities are ubiquitous. For example, driving to work contributes to traffic congestion, over-fishing and other over-uses of environmental resources depletes the environment for other users.In public finance, there are analogous shared resources problems. In the case of pensions, the resources are shared across time instead of contemporaneously. In the office refrigerator example, instead of many co-workers having to absorb the impact of one person’s pungent lunch, the mess left behind from the pungent food one day is absorbed the next day by future users. Municipal pensions across the United States today are similarly absorbing the underfunding that resulted from decisions often made decades earlier. Pensions represent pooled savings built up over time, and the resource that is shared is the responsibility to sufficiently contribute so that in the future the pension is fully funded. Effective stewardship of a municipal pension depends on meeting this shared responsibility for decades. For example, if decades ago a pension steward assumed a less conservative rate of return on invested contributions, he or she benefited from paying less into the pension fund, but this would have increased risks to future pension stewards from the higher risk to the pension investments.Today in the United States many municipal governments are contending with this issue. Private sector employers contend with analogous risks by insuring their pensions through the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC). The PBGC provides pension security to workers if the company they work for declares bankruptcy (though after 1 July 2009, PBGC changed its level of coverage). However, PBGC does not normally guarantee Federal, State or Local employer pensions. Hence, when a municipality enters financial distress, they are put in the difficult position of needing to defund pensions due to the consequences of decades of fiscal mismanagement by prior administrations.  The current administration may not have created the municipal crisis, but it is nevertheless responsible of navigating the restructuring while protecting and defending its citizens.Adding to this problem is that municipal governments must consider the needs of their residents, not just because this is a fundamental responsibility, but the success of the municipality depends on it. Municipalities in distress are vulnerable to a problem that is less often seen in sovereign restructurings and crises: the risk that residents will choose to leave.  While there are legal barriers to national emigration, residents can more freely choose to leave a territory or municipality within their country that is not economically viable. There are numerous cases where residents have relocated due to a deterioration during and associated with municipal default (e.g. Detroit). A declining population only exacerbates the municipal government’s problem.Unfortunately, many municipal pension systems do face financial difficulties due to prior years’ shortfalls in government employers’ pension contributions. There are no easy solutions to underfunded systems. And the reality of underfunded municipal pensions in the United States is acute: numerous municipal governments appear to have persistently understated their pension liabilities and overestimated returns in prior decades using ambitious actuarial assumptions, and the shortfalls accrued to present day pension stewards. There are few appealing options for addressing a pension shortfall. Jurisdictions facing crises have been forced to cut public pensions, for example Detroit.Whatever mechanisms or entities allegedly exist in the United States to surveil municipal bond markets and municipal pensions, the prima facia evidence of emerging nation-wide pension and municipal finance pressures suggests their work is not on par with the massive efforts that go into surveilling equity and corporate bond markets. Moreover, the reality of pension cuts resulting from municipal financial distress seems to leave municipal workers with the responsibility of carrying out due diligence on their employers’ present and future willingness and ability to appropriately fund their pensions (and possibly avoid bankruptcy altogether). Public opposition to municipal pension benefit reduction is understandable, and reflects the forced reckoning with the fiscal consequences of a pension system suffering from decades of underfunding and more generally the “problem of the commons” of municipal pension funding that continues to be largely ignored by market regulators.",

      "content"	 : "In February 2016, the Central Bank of Venezuela published a press release detailing economic performance in 2014 and 2015. At that time, the Venezuelan economy had experienced two consecutive years in recession and galloping inflation. Venezuelan economic activity was suffering the ravages of a decline in oil prices, which had fallen from U.S. $105.70/barrel in June 2014 to U.S. $37.19/barrel in December 2015 (US Energy Information Administration); as well as a 30% decrease in merchandise imports and a 8.1% decline in the manufacturing sector. This was the last time that the Central Bank of Venezuela published information about economic performance. The lack of information that followed has institutionalized opacity of public data in Venezuela and violates Article 319 of the Venezuelan Constitution, which states that the Central Bank of Venezuela is governed by the principle of public responsibility and “(…) will provide periodic reports on the behaviour of the macroeconomic variables of the country and on other matters that are requested and will include the analyses that allow for their evaluation.”Now, in the midst of a deep economic collapse, the Central Bank has finally released new data on macroeconomic performance. The release has not been without controversy and suspicion: given the current situation, the failure of the Maduro regime in economic matters is well-recognized. The release could be an attempt to garner credibility with the international community in order to access financing. Given the prolonged silence on economic and financial data, in May 2018 the International Monetary Fund issued a declaration of censure to the Venezuelan authorities, which implies that Venezuela cannot access IMF resources.Gross Domestic ProductUnder the Maduro regime, Venezuela has suffered a cumulative 37% collapse between 2013 and 2017, including declines of 80% in the construction sector, 62% in trade and repair services, and 53% in the manufacturing sector. Venezuelan domestic investment has fallen to approximately 10% of what it was in 2013, and private consumption has fallen over 40%. Thus far there are no definitive figures on GDP growth for the year 2018, which according to the IMF declined 18% compared to 2017.Figure 1. Quarterly Evolution of real GDP and potential GDP (%)Source: Central Bank of Venezuela, own calculationThe Venezuelan economic collapse is reflected in the behavior of potential output, which suffered a drop of 11% between 2013 and 2017. This drop indicates that the Venezuelan productive apparatus has been severely diminished by the economic policies of the socialist regime. In order for Venezuela to reach its potential output, it would need to grow at a rate of 1.7% for 21 consecutive years. This is the average growth rate of the late 1990s. Note that due to the continued decline in GDP through the third quarter of 2018 (latest data), as of 2019 the economy would need to maintain 1.7% growth for an additional 12 years (33 years total) in order to reach the maximum level of potential output.Imports and Foreign AssetsVenezuela’s total imports suffered a fall of almost 75% between 2013 and 2018. The most affected imports were those contributing to gross fixed capital formation (which declined nearly 90%) and also those destined for final consumption (which fell 87%). Despite the collapse in non-oil imports, due to a growth in petroleum imports of 59%, total imports grew by 24% with respect to the end of 2017. Oil imports represented 60.8% of total imports in 2018, up from less than 9% two decades earlier.Figure 2. Evolution of Venezuelan imports (US$ million)Source: Central Bank of Venezuela, own calculationsVenezuela’s asset position has significantly deteriorated along with the rest of the economy. In 2008, Venezuela accumulated a total of US $43,127 in assets, of which 75% consisted of liquid international reserves held by the Central Bank of Venezuela. This represents the peak over two decades. The asset position has since been declining to US $8,840, consisting mostly (64%) of monetary gold, a decrease of 80% in a span of ten years.Figure 3. Foreign exchange reserves and compositions in Venezuela (US$ million)Source: Central Bank of Venezuela, own calculationsDoubts about the authenticity of the informationWhile the deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela is evident, there are nonetheless doubts about the quality and authenticity of the Central Bank’s latest data release. The inflation data presented by the Central Bank of Venezuela are well below the estimates that presented by the Permanent Finance Committee of the National Assembly (Table 1). According to the organization Transparencia Venezuela, inflation data published by the BCV is underestimated because the authorities modified the weights used in the calculation of the price index(1). The International Monetary has not been able to verify the veracity of the information because it has not had contact with Central Bank officials(2).Authentic or not, the publication of the economic figures confirms the government’s deficient management of the economy and contradicts the government’s official position that the crisis in Venezuela is the result of an “economic war” orchestrated by the United States.Sources:  See source here  See source here",

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Foreign debt is a subject of significant debate in Venezuela, especially given the challenges faced by the Maduro government to meet its external obligations in the context of an economy that has already spent six consecutive years in deep recession and faces an increasingly meager flow of foreign currency due to the fall in oil prices (between 2014 and 2016) and ensuing collapse in oil production, difficulties in accessing financial markets, the erosion of the purchasing power of tax revenues due to hyperinflation, and internal political problems.2019 is a particularly difficult year, since Venezuela must honor a total of U.S. $8,081.19 million(1) for external debt bonds, of which about U.S. $985 million(2)  correspond to the payment of the PDVSA 2020 bond. The PDVSA bond is an instrument of particular importance since it has as collateral 50.1% of the capital of CITGO Holdings, Venezuela’s main physical asset abroad.BackgroundIn 2016, faced with liquidity problems due to low oil prices, the state oil company PDVSA sought to refinance its short-term debt through a bond exchange transaction to alleviate a depreciation profile that at that time was about U.S. $11,226 million(3)  (of which U.S. $8,100 million corresponded to principal and $3,166 million to the payment of interest). The eligible titles matured in April and November of 2017, with face values of U.S. $3,000 million and U.S. $4,100 million and coupons of 5.25% and 8.25%. Citgo was offered as collateral.  The estimated value of CITGO ranges between U.S. $8,000 and U.S. $13,000 million(4).The objective of this operation was the refinancing of the short-term financial debt, with the objective of alleviating the cash flow problems that PDVSA was going through at that time, and a maximum of U.S. $ 5,228 million(5) could be saved as a result of the future payments.**Legal challenges **The bond exchange was not without controversy. Its approval violated Article 150 of the Venezuelan Constitution, which requires that contracts of national public interest must be approved by the National Assembly. In addition, offering 50.1% of the shares of the subsidiary CITGO as collateral, though necessary for the exchange to be attractive, could be detrimental to the Republic if the obligation is unfulfilled, which would leave the country without a refining capacity of some 750,000 barrels per day(6).Current situationIn recent years, CITGO has been the subject of numerous international lawsuits and litigation from numerous foreign companies. The Canadian mining company Crystallex filed a lawsuit against Venezuela for U.S. $1,386 million as payment for obligations owed by the former president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez Frías(7). Earlier this year, the U.S. multinational ConocoPhillips won a lawsuit before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICSID) forcing the state oil company PDVSA to pay compensation of more than U.S. $8,000 million for the oil assets expropriated in 2007(8). The decision has been appealed at the direction of Juan Guaidó as acting president of Venezuela, with the objective of preserving the physical and financial assets of Venezuela abroad(9).At the end of April 2019, the Permanent Commission of Finance and Economic Development of the Venezuelan National Assembly agreed to carry out the payment of the PDVSA 2020 voucher for an amount of U.S. $71.5 million in interest in order to protect the assets of Venezuela abroad. The decision has fueled financial markets’ expectations of possible political change in Venezuela in the medium term. This payment will be made during the grace period once the Office of Control of Foreign Assets (OFAC) grants the license required for the payment to be carried out(10), which could take up to thirty days. According to Alejandro Grisanti(11), member of the ad hoc board of PDVSA appointed by Juan Guaidó, the resources will come from a custodial account of PDVSA that is under the control of acting president Juan Guaidó, instead of using CITGO’s money(12).The payment is part of a broader strategy to maintain investors’ interest in investing in the Venezuelan oil sector, as part of the “Plan Pais” strategy of supporting economic growth by leveraging the oil sector. The Guaido government is proposing changes in the legal and regulatory framework that would allow private companies to operate oil fields individually and in partnership with PDVSA(13).

      "title": "Gender Budgeting: a tool to enhance citizen welfare",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Gender Budgeting has captured the interest of different actors and countries throughout the years. Often, we hear and read reports where “gender budgeting”, “gender-responsive budget,” and “gender-sensitive budget” are mentioned but what does it all mean? And why should we care? Well, let us delve into what Gender Budgeting is from an expert’s lens.Motivations Behind Gender BudgetingIt all began in 1979, when the United Nation’s General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).  Since the roll-out of the CEDAW, 143 out of the 155 adopted the convention into their own country laws. Although, promises to combat gender disparities were made, evidence show that various forms of discrimination continue to persist in social norms, gender-based stereotypes, and laws and policies.Later, human rights activists recognized that ratifying international conventions were not the sole tool to combat gender disparities. Every action governments intend to implement needs a budget, and gender budgeting initiatives have been pursued in various forms over many years. Australia pioneered and piloted attempts at gender budgeting from 1984 and onwards in response to calls from women rights activists. Since the adoption of the convention, over 90 countries have experimented with some form of gender budgeting in the past decade. In 2013, Austria introduced Gender Budgeting as part of their broader package of performance budgeting reforms.Moreover, with the new global 2030 roadmap and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) approved by the UN in 2015, Goal 5’s aim is to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. Therefore, the SDG’s introduced a new indicator on Gender Budgeting which is: “Proportion of countries with systems to track and make public allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment”. In this context, any UN member state will be committed to achieve the targets of Goal 5 by 2030. Also, any failure in this area will leave negative impact on the country’s global scoring and ranking.Conceptual Facts on Gender-Responsive Budget (GRB)For those who are not familiar with gender-responsive budgeting (GRB), the first thought that comes to mind is that gender budgeting is associated with serving women only! When in fact, Gender- Responsive Budget is looking at budgets from a gender perspective. It does not mean allocating a specific budget to women and a specific budget to men to achieve a purpose or a plan. Rather, it is taking into account the gender perspective component during the planning and the implementation stages in order to respond to the specific needs of both women and men and let them have equal opportunities and accessibility to services and jobs. One way to address the gender disparity and to meet Goal 5 on Gender Equality of the Sustainable Development Goals is to use Gender-Responsive Budgeting in the area of public financial management.Budgets tend to mitigate consequences rather than address the root causes of issues. Often, budgets alone fail to ask questions such as, “Do women and men have equal access to resources and do both benefit from the resource use?” and “Do women and men participate in decision-making?” Not incorporating gender perspective in budgets for public-funds to finance programs and services is problematic in the long-term. This is because gradually social issues will be ignored, meaning that some groups will be left out from the decision-making process and will not be considered during the formulation of policies. Thus, assessing the budget from a gender perspective is an added layer that will provide more inclusive information of serving the needs of all people. Therefore, before allocating funds, it is imperative that we ask what are the key issues that we would like to solve? How will allocating funds impact the daily quality of life for women and men?Gender-Responsive Budgeting improves economic governance and financial management. It provides feedback to governments on whether they are meeting the needs of different groups. In addition, it provides feedback to actors outside of the government, GRB can be used to encourage transparency, accountability, and participation. The disaggregated data from Gender-Responsive Budgets can be used for different purposes including advocacy and providing information for better decision-making on policies. The data can also be used as a transparency tool to help civil society and other groups to monitor and to bring it to political leaders’ attention when policies and decisions are not inclusive, often leaving already disadvantaged groups worse-off.To better understand what Gender-Responsive Budgeting is and how it is used as a tool in public finance, what gender analysis entails, and what the existing gender-relevant indicators are, we consulted with DevTech’s own expert on Gender Budgeting, to shed light on this very important and multifaceted topic.As our Gender Budgeting expert, Arwa Al-Najdawi, explains, Gender-Responsive Budgeting is an application of gender mainstreaming in the budgetary process. It means:  a gender-based assessment of budgets;  incorporating a gender perspective at all levels of the budgetary process;  restructuring expenditures and revenues in order to promote gender equity and equality.In this context, Gender Budgeting is not merely a fiscal tool but an economic and social tool that aims to enhance citizens welfare. Through, (1) public awareness, understanding gender issues, and the overall impacts of public spending citizens; (2) Changing and modifying government budgets and national policies to be more gender sensitive; and (3) holding governments accountable for their gender budgetary and policy commitments (locally, nationally and internationally) by identifying gender relevant indicators into budget documents and linking them with the desired gender targets within the national policies and international standards.Core Pillars of Gender Budgeting include:  Data Availability: the availability of sex-disaggregated data is essential for analyzing and assessing budgetary impacts. This can involve better utilization of existing data (including census and relevant parties collected data) and the collection of new data (such as time use data, community data, official statistical data).  Monitoring &amp;amp; Evaluation System: In order to enhance Gender Budgeting a National Monitoring &amp;amp; Evaluation system should be in place embedded with gender relevant indicators to track the efficiency and effectiveness in public spending and take the proper measures to bridge the gender gap. Some examples of gender relevant indicators include; wage equality for similar work, women in Parliament, prevalence of gender violence, life expectancy age (female/male), gender gap in labor force participation, and gender employee ratio (female/male) in the public sector.  Reporting: Analyzing the budget from a gender perspective helps the government to recognize the different socio-economic roles, features, and needs of women, men, boys, and girls in society. Periodical reporting on Gender Budgeting and performance indicators will enable policy makers to formulate sound policies and allocating enough budgets to close the gender gap.If gender budgeting is implemented correctly and effectively, some of the predictive outcomes of this tool include:  Health: Budgeting to build hospitals, health centers, and hire medical professionals specifically in remote and rural areas, will enable all citizens to get good quality of health services. Governments can also take into consideration through the budgeting process the needs of specific gender age groups like children (girls and boys), elderly (females &amp;amp; males), and vulnerable groups such as people with disabilities.  On the national level some of the desired outcomes that could be achieved are increasing the life expectancy age and reducing the mortality rates.  Politically: Specific budget allocations to conduct sessions on raising political awareness in schools, universities, and local communities, will ultimately lead to an increase in women’s’ participation in the political arena.  Economic Participation of Women: Budgeting to implement effective measures to attract women to the labor market by creating pre-school and kindergarten classrooms at workplaces, promoting secured and friendly transportation, and enforcing strict penalties on employers that violate laws combating sexual harassment at workplace. In the end, these measures will lead to increased women’s economic participation in the labor market.  Unemployment between youth with low educational attainment: Budgeting to establish vocational training centers with equipment to improve the capabilities of both males and females and engage them in the labor market. This will lead to reduce unemployment rates, combat poverty, and empower all citizens economically and socially. It is recommended that in order to increase awareness on GRB, training sessions are provided at all levels for example: including the Budget Officers and Monitoring and Evaluation officers at the Ministry of Finance and other implementing ministries.  Additionally, creating a friendly parliament to gender budgeting will promote the public debate on the budget from a gender perspective. In this context, building the capacities of Parliament Members in this area will enhance the Gender-Responsive Budget.Lastly, advocating for communities’ participatory approach in preparing the budget from a gender perspective will result in meeting the specific gender needs within each community. As development practitioners and advocates of gender equality, we should remember to include gender in our programs and projects in all stages, including in the designing, planning, and implementation of budgets, for long-term sustainability.",

      "content"	 : "Legislating “in the dark” in an anomaly in the age of big dataInternational Monetary Fund, 2019In a new working paper (1), the International Monetary Fund pointed out that the use of empirical data in insolvency law analysis has been sporadic. This paper provides a conceptual framework for the use of data to assess insolvency systems. The design of a good system requires the use of both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks. Compliance with international standards is very important for every country (especially less developed ones), but this only satisfies the qualitative part of the system. Data is needed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of every step of the process and to identify bottlenecks.For example, the closing a business component of the Doing Business report published by the World Bank is based on a hypothetical case of closing a business in a city. Although this information is important to compare a country with others, it is necessary to have real information about the day-to-day practices to be able to precisely identify what is making a country lag.This paper also emphasizes that there is a common misconception that data is scarce. However, data is already collected by many different agencies such as financial institutions, courts, and several government agencies. Data is widely available, but there is need for interdisciplinary expertise to extract and analyze it. To save costs it is recommended to use existing infrastructure. If there is no infrastructure, the creation of special registries offers an excellent opportunity to design data collection tools that categorize the information to facilitate its analysis.It is also important to acknowledge that there are trade-offs in the design of data collection mechanisms, such as the need to respect data protection rules and banking commercial secrecy, so anonymization of data is essential.  https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/02/04/The-Use-of-Data-in-Assessing-and-Designing-Insolvency-Systems-46549",

      "content"	 : "From April 15 to April 18, 2019, DevTech presented a panel session on the Community Action for Reading and Security (CARS) Activity at the Comparative and International Education Society (CIES) Conference that took place in San Francisco.The purpose of the CARS activity is to (a) improve early grade reading outcomes and (b) contribute to reducing citizen insecurity in five municipalities in the Southern Autonomous Caribbean Coast Region (Región Autónoma de la Costa Caribe Sur - RACCS) and three municipalities of the Northern Autonomous Caribbean Coast Region (Región Autónoma Costa Caribe Norte - RACCN) of Nicaragua. The eight municipalities include: Bluefields, Kukra Hill, Pearl Lagoon, Corn Island, Desembocadura de Rio Grande, Waspam, Prinzapolka and Puerto Cabezas.Three papers were presented at the panel. The first paper presented the contextual information needed to introduce the interventions being conducted under CARS. Because the RACCN and RACCS are regions in Nicaragua that do not mirror those of the overall country, it is of most importance to provide a background of the area, its people, and their challenges. With limited data previously collected and much less material developed for young learners, the data and literacy rates background are crucial in contextualizing the work being performed by CARS.The second paper presented our community approach to working with at-risk students in non-formal education. In response to the growing literacy gaps in RACCN and RACCS, CARS implemented the “Spaces to Grow” (Espacios para Crecer- EpCs) intervention, serving the most at-risk students. EpCs were created as a response to limited resources for students lagging on reading levels in RACCN and RACCS in comparison to their peers in mainland Nicaragua. This intervention was introduced as an accelerated after-school program to provide at-risk students with the tools they needed to achieve success in formal schooling.The third paper described our steps moving forward and current research conducted in RACCN and RACCS.  Keeping in mind CARS’ interest in knowledge generation and management, CARS developed a study focusing on Prinzapolka reading performance for students in first to third grade to inform and facilitate decision-making for implementation actions and projects aimed at meeting the current demand for services of quality in the municipality. Data for this project was collected at the end of 2017 on information related to reading performance, nutritional status of children, and socio-educational information of families. The study’s aim was to provide a clear picture of the current condition of the population of Prinzapolka and propose actions to improve both the educational condition and of the security of the communities where the project intervenes.For more information on CARS, please see the project page here.",

Its approval violated Article 150 of the Venezuelan Constitution, which requires that contracts of national public interest must be approved by the National Assembly. In addition, offering 50.1% of the shares of the subsidiary CITGO as collateral, though necessary for the exchange to be attractive, could be detrimental to the Republic if the obligation is unfulfilled, which would leave the country without a refining capacity of some 750,000 barrels per day(6).Current SituationIn recent years, CITGO has been the subject of numerous international lawsuits and litigation from numerous foreign companies. The Canadian mining company Crystallex filed a lawsuit against Venezuela for U.S. $1,386 million as payment for obligations owed by the former president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez Frías(7).  Earlier this year, the U.S. multinational ConocoPhillips won a lawsuit before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICSID) forcing the state oil company PDVSA to pay compensation of more than U.S. $8,000 million for the oil assets expropriated in 2007(8). The decision has been appealed at the direction of Juan Guaidó as acting president of Venezuela, with the objective of preserving the physical and financial assets of Venezuela abroad(9).At the end of April 2019, the Permanent Commission of Finance and Economic Development of the Venezuelan National Assembly agreed to carry out the payment of the PDVSA 2020 voucher for an amount of U.S. $71.5 million in interest in order to protect the assets of Venezuela abroad. The decision has fueled financial markets’ expectations of possible political change in Venezuela in the medium term. This payment will be made during the grace period once the Office of Control of Foreign Assets (OFAC) grants the license required for the payment to be carried out(10),  which could take up to thirty days.  According to Alejandro Grisanti(11),  member of the ad hoc board of PDVSA appointed by Juan Guaidó, the resources will come from a custodial account of PDVSA that is under the control of acting president Juan Guaidó, instead of using CITGO’s money(12).The payment is part of a broader strategy to maintain investors’ interest in investing in the Venezuelan oil sector, as part of the “Plan Pais” strategy of supporting economic growth by leveraging the oil sector. The Guaido government is proposing changes in the legal and regulatory framework that would allow private companies to operate oil fields individually and in partnership with PDVSA(13).1: Source: Rendivalores.com2: This amount includes interest and principal payments for this year.

      "content"	 : "Stopping the flow of illegal immigration from Central America to the U.S is a cornerstone of the Trump administration’s policies. In recent years, immigration has become a third rail topic in American politics. However, migration from Central America to the United States is not a new phenomenon, despite the heavy focus on border security at the U.S-Mexico border. The Trump administration has called illegal immigration at the border between the U.S and Mexico a crisis. With the aim to gain a  better understanding of the rationale behind illegal immigration from Central America, DevTech has carried out a case study on human smugglers (known as coyotes) in Guatemala on behalf of the U.S. Department of State.The study captured the structure, organization and marketing strategies of coyotes in three Western Highland regions of Guatemala. The DevTech team interviewed active and inactive coyotes, families with migrants in the United States, and migrants who recently returned to Guatemala from the United States. The team also captured radio and social media advertisements promoting coyote services to the U.S.The demand to migrate, whether it be for a better life, escaping violence, or family reunification, is a difficult and personal choice that many families in Guatemala and across Latin America make. The high demand to migrate to the U.S, is reflected by limited opportunities in Guatemala and few mechanisms of migrating legally, leading to a prosperous illegal migration market.Although most Americans see coyotes as heartless, the study’s respondents had mixed feelings. On the one hand, coyotes can be heavily connected and knowledgeable about the safest routes to travel and will deliver migrants to their destination unharmed. And on the other hand, some coyotes may use their power to take advantage of their clients putting them at personal and financial risk. Nevertheless, most respondents interviewed did not know how to travel to the US legally through a visa program. If respondents had heard of a temporary visa, visas were seen as unattainable and expensive. Meanwhile coyotes, although expensive, are available in communities and are perceived as more likely to be successful in helping migrants reach the United States.Even though human smuggling is illegal in Guatemala, coyotes still market their services, often publicly. Respondents claim coyotes can be contacted through personal references or radio ads. Coyotes in small communities will advertise their services on local radio stations or at a greater scale on social media, masked as U.S tourism ads.Curtailing illegal immigration involves a closer look at reasons why individuals migrate.  If demand drops for migration services, then the supply of coyotes may decrease as well. By improving opportunities in Guatemala and other Latin American countries, citizens may not have to make the difficult choice of leaving their country.Research Team (left to right): Phil Church, Mario Moreno, Atilio Aguilera, Meredith Kerrigan, Alfonso Arrivillaga",

      "content"	 : "April 7th was World Health Day! First celebrated in 1950, World Health Day marks the founding of the World Health Organization (WHO), which was founded in April 1948. In recent years World Health Day has been celebrated as a global health awareness day. Each year the Day’s awareness campaign focuses on a specific priority health theme, which have recently included mental health, vector-borne diseases, food safety, and protecting health from the adverse effects of climate change. The theme for World Health Day 2019 is “Universal Health Coverage: everyone, everywhere.”This year’s awareness campaign seeks to educate individuals about universal health care—what it is, why it is important, and what life is like for individuals living without access to health services. The 2019 campaign is an opportunity for stakeholders everywhere to advocate for equal health care access for everyone, everywhere.Equal access to health care, however, requires more than the physical presence of adequate health services. Those services must also be accessible financially. Health care expenses are one of the major initiators of the so-called poverty ratchet—where a family is pushed deeper into poverty by unforeseen shocks that deprive them of the means to recover. To purchase antibiotics for a sick child, for example, a family may be forced to sell their livestock—one of their few assets and their primary source of income. The family now lacks the very resource they needed to overcome the sudden expense of their child’s healthcare; they become trapped in a worsened state of poverty.The challenges to universal health care are varied and complex, but a concerted global effort—involving primary care providers all the way up to government decision-makers—can identify and work to resolve those challenges. DevTech Systems, Inc. is proud to contribute to those efforts through our work on the S4SIPMS project, which monitors the quality and effectiveness of PEPFAR-funded sites in Nigeria.Additional information about the S4SIPMS project can be found here: https://devtechsys.com/projects/Nigeria-Support-for-Strategic/Additional information about World Health Day 2019 can be found on the WHO website: https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/world-health-day-2019",

      "content"	 : "From March 13 to March 15, 2019, three members of the MEL Activity participated in the 9th African Evaluation Association International Conference 2019 Abidjan, Cote d’IvoireThe Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) Activity attended the 9th African Evaluation Association (AfrEA) conference between March 13-15, 2019 in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. The conference is the premier event in the African Evaluation sector and acts as the foundation for promoting and advocating the Association’s “Made in Africa” approach. It allows knowledge sharing, collaboration and networking with a wide range of international organizations and individuals. This year’s conference theme was, “Accelerating Africa’s Development: Strengthening National Evaluation Ecosystems.” Attendees from the MEL Activity included: Samuel Gyang, Senior Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Specialist for Analysis; Olufolake Akeju, Senior Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Specialist for Health; Mukhtar Ijaiya, Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Specialist for Health.The poster titles that the MEL Specialist presented on were: “The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Nigeria’s MEL Activity Model”; “Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Challenge Tuberculosis (CTB) Nigeria Intervention in Strengthening the Health System Response for TB Control”; and “Evaluating the Effectiveness of Promoting the Quality of Medicines (PQM)’s Technical Assistance (TA) in the Strengthening of Medicines Regulatory Quality Assurance (QA) Systems in Nigeria.” The MEL Activity staff attended the various conference sessions, while presenting their posters and answering attendees’ questions on the posters’ content between sessionsDr. Folake Akeju, who attended the health-related sessions of the conference, which made up the largest portion of the conference, said it made her more aware of different kinds of research that people in our field are doing in the health sector. One aspect that was particularly interesting was the different evaluation methods for health projects, such as the “most significant change theory” methodology for family planning intervention, which has typically been viewed as an unconventional methodology. Folake cited the experience as a great way to meet different people from different countries, hear about their work – “the exposure was really great.” She also met a lot of Nigerians and got a chance to see a more in-depth view of the work going on in her own country.Fellow MEL Specialist Mukhtar Ijaiya agreed – learning about the different methodologies was one of the most interesting learning aspects at the AfrEA conference. In one of the most interesting sessions, the presenter, an experienced evaluator, spoke about how modern evaluators need to embrace data science, and be systematic about data collection. “With the advent of big data and data scientists – you need to be careful, when you are evaluating, to pay attention to data quality.” He mentioned it was also very interesting to see how posters from other program areas looked at the current situation in the Nigerian context.MEL Specialist for Analysis Sam Gyang was also excited to learn about the new trends in evaluation – particularly the shift from using small sample sizes to evaluate a project to taking advantage of “big data”, like using satellite images to track road construction process, as one presenter exemplified. Phone calls and social media, “human generated big data” as Sam specified, shows an exciting future for evaluation. The challenge will be how to incorporate data scientists into the evaluation process to produce the most value. Sam went on to quote Dr. Michael Bamberger, a renowned and world class evaluation professional, and key note speaker at the AfrEA conference, “Professional evaluators risk being obsolete and losing relevance without understanding the application of data science to evaluation.”Participants also got to meet with Dr Zakari Lawal, Director of the M&amp;amp;E department in the Nigerian Ministry of Budget and National Planning, with whom they discussed increasing involvement in the Nigerian Association of Evaluators (NAE)All three MEL Specialists stated that it would be a great opportunity to attend the preconference workshops if they were to present at the next AfrEA Conference. Their interactions with participants who attended these workshops highlighted how insightful and innovative the presentations were and how the workshops added to their skills and knowledge of managing and conducting evaluations. The team also stressed that they are looking forward to submitting more abstracts, across more sectors, to next year’s conference.(left to right) Mukhtar Ijaiya, Folake Akeju, Samuel Gyang  at the African Evaluation Association Conference",

      "title": "DevTech Staff visit New Kuchingoro IDP Camp",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "DevTech Systems Inc. (S4SIPMS and MEL Projects) visited the IDP (internally displaced persons) camp located at New Kunchingoro, Games Village, FCT Abuja on Thursday March 14th, 2019 to distribute children’s reading materials donated by DevTech staff and delivered by Skip Waskin during his visit to Nigeria in January 2019.New Kuchingoro is a community in Lugbe Division, a suburb of Abuja Municipal Area Council, AMAC, Federal Capital Territory, FCT, near National Stadium, by Games Village in Abuja. The New Kuchingoro IDP camp is currently home to about 1,550 inhabitants who were displaced in 2014 from their ancestral homes in Borno, Adamawa, Yobe, and Bauchi states, by insurgency and Fulani Herdsmen. The majority of inhabitants are women and children who have no way to support themselves and their families.The standard of living in this camp is better imagined than experienced, with issues of hygiene and security a major concern. The entirety of the camp shares one open pit latrine and one bathroom provided by an NGO, causing overcrowding and unsanitary conditions. The government does not provide security for the camp, and instead security is provided by the Civilian Joint Task Force, who are themselves IDPs. Members of the JTF do not have any type of professional security training, and police only become involved if criminal behavior is reported to the local division.The camp’s primary school was the focus of DevTech’s visit. The primary school serves 120 students and runs without professionally trained teachers and with minimal educational resources. The school is run by Principal Enoch Yohanna, who has a degree in statistics, but never taught or worked in a primary school until coming to New Kuchingoro as an IDP.  Several DevTech staff were part of the visit, including Nigeria S4SIPMS Chief of Party Carol Shepherd, Nigeria MEL Activity Deputy Chief of Party Salima Mutima, and S4SIPMS Regional Finance Officer Pricewill Ekeocha. With so much uncertainty and difficulties faced by the camp and the school in general, Principal Yohanna discussed several major points:  The Importance of Education: The need for continued education for the IDP Camp children. It’s importance, he said, cannot be overemphasized. Education will go a long way to mitigate the social vices and even the insurgency being experienced in the country, as an educated person will be more likely to get work and understand the social, political, and economic context of their situation and that of their country. To this end, the school supports a sponsorship program for students. The program entails taking responsibility for the upkeep of a sponsored child (or children). N3,000 (~$8.5) per month will cover a uniform and other materials for one child. The program encourages sponsors to make visits to the school to get to know the students and understand how they are contributing to the child’s educational advancement.  Need for Resources: The school is in need of uniforms, writing materials, and reading materials. During the visit most of the students were dressed in street clothes, and Principal Yohanna said that any individual or group support in these areas is greatly appreciated.  Need for Volunteer Teachers: The school welcomes individuals or groups who can volunteer to teach. They are looking for teachers in all subject areas who can work with students to increase their knowledge base.After much discussion the DevTech representatives presented the collected books to the students. Principal Yohanna and the students thanked DevTech for the contribution.  See pictures below.",

      "content"	 : "The collapse has arrived: Venezuela suffers its longest blackout in recent yearsBeginning the afternoon of March 7, 18 of the 23 states of Venezuela suffered a power outage that lasted for five consecutive days. Although the Venezuelan electrical grid has suffered numerous collapses in its operation since its nationalization under the regime of socialist leader Hugo Chávez in 2007, with programmed cuts and blackouts of up to four days recorded in recent years, the March 2019 blackout is unprecedented in scope. According to the president of the Venezuelan Association of Electrical, Mechanical and Allied Energy (Aviem), the blackout was caused by a fire in the sub-station “Malena”, located in the El Guri dam, causing two of the three lines of the electrical system to collapse. This latest outage occurred in the context of a complete lack of maintenance of the entire electric power generation and distribution system in Venezuela(1).Figure 1, Source: Netblocks.orgDuring the days without electricity, preliminary reports state that at least 21 people, including six newborns, died as a result of lack of electrical power in hospitals and the total collapse of the mobile telephone lines, the underground transport system, and the country’s electronic payment system (2).    Looting was observed in supermarkets and shopping centres in various cities. Empresas Polar, the largest producer of processed foods in Venezuela, reported a loss of US $5.6 million from looting in the city of Maracaibo.Since Monday, March 11, electric service has been partially, gradually, and intermittently restored throughout Venezuela. As of March 13, there were still reports of outages in some areas of the western states of Apure, Merida, Táchira, Trujillo and Zulia, and several blackouts in central and south-western Caracas were reported on March 15(3).Problems with telecommunications and potable water service have also persisted. It has been reported that in recent days, in the face of persistent failures in water supply exacerbated by faults in the supply of electricity, residents of Caracas have resorted to collecting water from the Guaire river, which is not suitable for human consumption(4).The banking system has been restored, though it is operating with reduced hours. Service on the underground transport system in Caracas was restored on Wednesday March 13, but suffered a crash after three wagons derailed. Despite the restoration of electric service, experts expect that another major blackout will recur in the coming days due to the persistent serious deficiencies of the electrical system and the fact that the generation of electric power in the country is insufficient to meet internal demand(5).More difficulties: Plummeting oil production and increasing oil restrictions for VenezuelaThe economic outlook for Venezuela continues to deteriorate. In its monthly report, OPEC reported that Venezuelan oil production stood at 1,008,000 barrels per day, a decrease of 12.3% compared to last January, and a decrease of 14% compared to December 2018. These levels of production represent a historical minimum since January 2003, when Venezuelan crude production collapsed by 78.9% as a result of an oil strike that began in December 2002(6).Figure 2: Monthly Oil Production, Source: OPEC, Thomson-ReutersThe Maduro regime is also facing increasingly complicated external financing conditions. This situation is aggravated by the fact that the Maduro regime faces payments for compensation for past expropriations: they must pay ConocoPhillips the sum of US $8,140 million for the seizure of its oil and gas assets in 2007, during the regime of Hugo Chávez(7).  At the same time, continuing pressure towards the socialist regime in Venezuela, the government of India has ordered that its companies stop buying oil from the Maduro regime to avoid US sanctions. After the United States, India is the second largest recipient of Venezuelan crude and also one of the few purchasing countries that pay in cash. In the first half of February 2019, shipments of crude oil to India reached 620,000 barrels per day, a 66% increase compared to the end of January 2019(8).The Guaidó administration consolidates its international positionOn March 15, the Inter-American Development Bank accepted the appointment of Ricardo Haussman as Venezuela’s representative in the institution, becoming the first multilateral international body to recognize the parliamentarian Juan Guaidó as president in charge of Venezuela as the country faces an increasingly critical economic and social situation. President of the IDB, Luis Alberto Moreno, had previously expressed his willingness to work with Guaidó and his delegation on various investment and development projects for Venezuela. Hausmann was the IDB’s chief economist between 1994 and 2000, as well as Minister of Planning and member of the board of directors of the Central Bank of Venezuela during the second term of former Venezuelan President Carlos Andrés Pérez in 1992 and 1993. Following Professor Hausmann’s appointment, plans will be carried out to restore Venezuela’s access to external financial markets.(1)See: http://globovision.com/article/winston-cabas-explico-las-razones-de-la-crisis-electrica-que-afecta-a-toda-venezuela(2)See: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/venezuela-blackout-deaths-latest-news-caracas-opposition-claims-(3)See: https://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/mundo/america-latina/venezuela-es/ article227502069.html,http://www.venezuelaaldia.com/2019/03/15/caracas-se-volvio-a-quedar-sin-luz-este-15mar/(4)See: https://elcomercio.pe/mundo/venezuela/venezuela-caracas-venezolanos-desesperan-agua-estragos-apagon-nicolas-maduro -juan-guaido-photos-news-617009(5)The engineer Víctor Poleo estimates a deficit of about 3,000 megawatts in electricity generation in Venezuela.

      "title": "Working in Non-Permissive Environments: Arming Civilians isn't the Answer",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "USAID has long sought to develop an approach for the rapid deployment of its staff into high threat regions.   One idea is to develop “Rapid Expeditionary Development – RED” teams.  A heretofore obscure February 2018 report sponsored by USAID’s Global Development Laboratory outlines one possible configuration of the RED teams, and has recently drawn considerable attention, and generated considerable controversy, for its suggestion that in certain circumstances USAID employees should be trained in the use of and authorized to carry firearms.Specifically, the report recommends that “to secure communities vulnerable to violent extremist radicalization and exploitation”, USAID personnel working in such areas be paired with military counterparts into two-person “RED Teams” that would “live and work in austere environments for extended periods of time and actively contribute to their own security and welfare.”  RED team members, it adds euphemistically, “would be trained and authorized to conduct themselves as a force-multiplier able to contribute a full suite of security skills as needed.”  In other words, they would carry guns and be expected to use them.  This, the authors argue, is essential to allow USAID personnel in such vulnerable areas to function effectively and carry out their development mission alongside their military colleagues.Having directed or coordinated USAID assistance programs in places as dangerous, and diverse, as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Haiti for the better part of the last twelve years, I strongly believe that, in almost all cases, arming civilian development assistance professionals is unnecessary and likely to be counterproductive.  The only exception might be in certain very limited situations, notably during or in the immediate aftermath of kinetic operations, or in response to a humanitarian crisis where active fighting exists.  Such cases, however, should be exceedingly rare.  Moreover, even if USAID officers are authorized to bear arms, it must be clearly understood that they are to be used only in extremis and only for defensive purposes.While USAID actions are indeed part of foreign policy programming, identifying USAID staff as part of a military response would put at risk both those staff and their partners, not just in the short term but potentially far longer.  Moreover, the confusion of roles and identities that this proposed mingling of the civilian and military missions would cause would greatly impede the effectiveness of the civilian mission while adding little if any contribution to the military’s objectives.  This is not to say that USAID cannot work closely with DOD counterparts – it can, and it does.  There are many examples of strong coordination and collaboration between the USAID and the Department of Defense.  But RED, at least as described in this report, is not the way forward.While the recommendations contained in this report are provocative and attention-getting, they divert focus from the very real, and much more typical, challenges development professionals from USAID and other agencies routinely face in what are typically known as “non-permissive environments.”  The fact is that many civilian development professionals have already developed successful ways of carrying out their missions in a wide range of difficult environments - approaches that don’t involve carrying guns but rather facilitate the much more important (in development terms) task of finding ways to work with and understand the needs of the local population despite the dangers involved.Let’s start with one basic fact: many if not most of the environments in which development professionals work today are, to one extent or another, non-permissive. Most of the places in which USAID operates in Latin America, in sub-Saharan Africa, in the Middle East, in Asia, and in countries of the former Soviet Union are plagued by some type of violence or inhospitable environment, be it gang- or drug-related, political, geographic or meteorological, sectarian, terrorist, or purely criminal.  It is for example, arguably as or more dangerous to work in San Pedro Sula, Honduras than in Karachi, Pakistan - although for totally different reasons. And working in Haiti, with a natural disaster occurring roughly once every six months, or in a country such as Belarus whose government is actively hostile to the USG presence, can be as challenging as is working in a country that poses more obvious physical risks. Yet USAID officers in these places routinely find ways to carry out their mission successfully while working through or around these dangers.  How do they do it?My own experience suggests a few basic principles that may be useful to follow.  First, development professionals must be acutely sensitive to security concerns.  That doesn’t mean they need to hide in their compounds, or cower “behind the wire“.  It does mean that they need to coordinate very closely on security issues with their colleagues in the State Department (and/or, depending on the theater in which they are operating, their colleagues in the military).  In particular, USAID officers are well advised to work very closely with the talented and dedicated professionals in the Regional Security Offices in each Embassy.  USAID officers need to make sure that the RSOs are familiar with the activities and objectives of assistance programs.  This will enable the RSOs to put in place security protocols that allow USAID to carry out its mission while protecting the safety and security of the USAID employees themselves and of the communities and individuals they seek to benefit.  Security officers aren’t trying to stop USAID officers from working; rather they’re trying to help USAID officers succeed while keeping them safe.  USAID staff, and development professionals from other agencies, need to recognize this and make their security colleagues part of the team.Second, once that rapport and mutual understanding is established, USAID staff in non-permissive environments then need to lean forward as far as security regulations permit to establish and maintain effective contacts and working relationships with their counterparts in the host country, be it with the local government, with the local private sector or philanthropic community, or among the communities USAID programs are intended to benefit.  Granted, in non-permissive environments, the simple act of visiting the office of a government minister can be a major security and logistical challenge.  Trying to arrange visits to project sites at schools or farms or businesses in remote areas can be even more challenging.  But USAID’s experience demonstrates it is possible, given proper advance planning – and particularly, proper coordination with and support from the RSO.  If it proves impossible to meet with counterparts at their offices, or to visit project sites, bring them, or the key personnel from the project to the USAID office – or meet them at a safe alternative location (e.g., a cleared local hotel) if they are reluctant to come to the Embassy.  As I learned in the 1980s via a common saying in the country then known as Zaire (another non-permissive environment), “Il y a toujours moyenne” (“There’s always a way.”)  In the final analysis, development is all about personal relationships – and in creating and maintaining personal relationships, there is no substitute for face to face contact.Finally, development professionals in non-permissive environments, and the senior officials to whom they report in their capitals, need to accept that there will always be significant inherent limits on their ability to gather and report accurate data on the results achieved by the programs they are funding.  In some places, it is simply impossible to send expatriate employees to project sites to verify for themselves that what counterparts report is happening is in fact actually happening.  In these circumstances, USAID officers have demonstrated exceptional creativity and resourcefulness in finding ways to acquire the reliable information they need.  If U.S. civilians are not allowed to visit a particular area, they send local national employees (always, of course, in accordance with the applicable security protocols and with scrupulous attention to the safety of those employees).  If U.S. government employees can’t go, they hire contractors.  And if no one is allowed to visit, they rely on aerial photographs and other remote sensing techniques; Google Earth, in this context, becomes an incredibly valuable tool.  In these circumstances, the services of experienced, expert private firms like DevTech Systems can be exceptionally useful to development agencies; firms like ours are skilled at both using advanced techniques for collecting data and in interpreting that data.Leon S.

    "insights-2019-02-25-highlights-from-the-world-bank-data-day": {
      "title": "Highlights from the World Bank Data Day",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "On February 13th, 2019, DevTech Systems attended the first ever World Bank Data Day at its Headquarters in Washington, DC. DevTech participated in the Data Day Fair and Senior Economist Anne Bernier and Data Analysts Evan Williams and CJ Tracey attended talks throughout the day. Here are some highlights from the day:Anne Bernier:My two favorite talks were about using big data to measure economic concepts faster, and in more detail, than official government statistics.  In one lightening talk, Juni Zhu (World Bank) demonstrated how LinkedIn data can answer questions about changing employment in the tech sector in lower and middle-income countries, and skills mismatch between recent graduates and job openings.  In another talk, Richard Record and Sam Fraiberger described how tweets and online news can be analyzed to create economic sentiment indices that are cheaper and faster than government-run confidence surveys. Sentiment indices can be very helpful leading indicators of GDP growth and employment.Evan Williams:The morning sessions of Data Day focused primarily on the use of Machine Learning and Big Data within the international development field.All of the talks and discourse boiled down to one simple statement: machine learning has the potential to be a game-changer for international development. Satellite imagery has revolutionized the way we monitor electrification rates (and by extension priority areas) in Africa. GPS data from taxi and ridesharing services have identified bottlenecks and infrastructure deficiencies more accurately, cheaply, and efficiently than traditional surveys ever could. Web scraping provides economic data in countries where official statistics are not trustworthy. The use of network data can be used to spread health information and contain epidemics. Video data (which would be extremely expensive for humans to monitor), could monitor teacher absenteeism cheaply and with a high degree of accuracy.However, while machine learning gives us so many more tools to do good in the world, it also can be used in unethical ways. The two big elephants in the ML room are the hype of ML/AI, and more significantly, the issue of privacy. As with all hype, algorithms applied incorrectly can also do more harm than good.  A bigger issue may be that, particularly in countries with high levels of corruption, big data can become a tool of coercion and control. It’s important to consider the ethical application and use of data, and there is, a growing need for international organizations to focus on ethical concerns within data and machine learning application.CJ Tracey:Although I found the entire session interesting, three speakers really stood out. First, the keynote speaker Roberta Gatti discussed the development of the Human Capital Index (HCI), a highly successful World Bank project that directly ties health and education to productivity. Hearing the thought process that led to the development of the index was insightful, and their focus on outcomes, coverage, salience, coherence, and ownership should be kept in mind when creating future indices. Additionally, the discussion at the end with Ms. Gatti and Simeon Djankov was interesting and provided additional insight into the development and use of indices. Ms. Gatti again highlighted the struggle between simplicity and comprehensiveness when developing the index and Mr. Djankov, referencing future plans for the index, stated that the World Bank should be careful not to overburden the index and should stick to different tools for different tasks.Second, Charles Fox from the Geospatial Operational Support Team talked about their development of a rapid healthcare access assessment for Yemen. Their objective was to estimate access to healthcare in Yemen, where the World Bank has been unable to send missions since 2015. They used open source information and created an open source algorithm (available on GitHub) that could estimate access to healthcare services and is adaptable to new information as it becomes available. This highlighted the use of new open source technologies to create a flexible and responsive tool where the use of traditional methods is not possible.Finally, Malar Veerappan from the Development Data Group spoke about maximizing the value and use of the World Bank’s data assets. This is very applicable to DevTech’s work on creating a space for accessible data with the ESDB. She stated that there needs to be a large movement toward a reused and integrated data community in order to reduce time spent on data-prep.",

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Since 2016, DevTech’s S4SIPMS project has supported PEPFAR’s commitment to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by implementing hundreds of SIMS assessments across Nigeria.SIMS is a Site Improvement through Monitoring System, created by Ambassador Deborah Brix in 2014. At its core, SIMS is a quality assurance methodology used to increase the impact of PEPFAR programs through standardized monitoring of the quality of HIV/AIDS-related services. The tools are comprised of assessments that score the quality of care provided against PEPFAR quality of care standards.The Department of State’s Office of the US Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) recently released SIMS 4.0 – the newest version of the SIMS assessment tool. SIMS 4.0 is the most technical version of the tool to date, requiring deep knowledge to assess PEPFAR programs and relate those scores to Monitoring, Evaluation and Recording (MER) indicators. The release of SIMS 4.0 created a flurry of activity for DevTech’s S4SIPMS team. The staff in Abuja have trained assessors on the new SIMS 4.0 tools while simultaneously completing roughly ten assessments per week. On Thursday, January 31, the Chief of Party, Deputy Chief of Party, and Capacity Building Specialist hosted seven implementing partners (IPs) in Abuja for a training on SIMS 4.0 to prepare IPs to successfully apply the tool to their PEPFAR program sites. Some of the IP training content included:  How to prioritize sites for assessment  How SIMS 4.0 differs from previous versions and what that means for IPs  The new scoring system used in SIMS 4.0  How to identify the required vs. elective elements of an assessmentAll Operating Units (OUs) are required by PEPFAR to use the SIMS tools, and most OUs oversee SIMS scheduling, assessments, and management of IPs without the engagement of third-party contractors.  However, DevTech’s highly skilled team in Abuja was entrusted with the training of IPs in Nigeria due to their high level of competency with SIMS tools and assessment management. In fact, S4SIPMS is the only standalone SIMS project in the world, and DevTech’s work in Nigeria has become the industry standard thanks to the team’s great work over the past three years.",

      "content"	 : "What do you do?I am a Senior Analyst on the USAID Data Services Team (ADVISE) and a member of the Foreign Assistance team. The team is responsible for fulfilling USAID’s reporting responsibility of US foreign assistance spending to the Congress and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and reporting USAID’s spending to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI).What are 5 things you do almost every day?Every task I have is collaborative in some sense, so I’m communicating with people, both colleagues and clients, on a daily basis. I write or update some sort of program almost every day. I’m always working on multiple tasks, so I keep my tasks list updated and organized as much as possible. I do my best to monitor various forums to stay up to date on discussions and news from OECD, IATI, etc.Do you have a morning ritual? Something you do to start your day?When I first get in, I scan through the emails and newsletters sent by USAID. Yes, they are dry, but they often have useful bits of information.What kind of skills do you need to be effective in your role?Much of my job can be thought of as problem solving. We often have to find creative solutions to fulfill requests or complete tasks.  This might be finding the best way to estimate aid spending in particular sector or how to most efficiently use computer resources when processing large datasets. I also find that being able to efficiently switch between tasks is very important. I’m usually completing multiple tasks concurrently, or have to stop one task to complete a more urgent one.What is one word you would use to describe DevTech’s culture? Why?Collegial. Within the Foreign Assistance team and the wider US Data Services Team I have found that people are always willing to help and take on tasks.What do you like best about your job?I’ve really enjoyed collaborating with colleagues outside of USAID in various development agencies and CSOs. Interacting with colleagues from around the world has given me a better understanding of the wider development community and USAID’s place within in it.  This collaboration has also given me a chance to travel, which I’ve really enjoyed.What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Senior Analyst?Learn the type of skills that transfer across any subject area. Subject matter expertise is important, but skills in analytical techniques and software are more broadly applicable and useful.",

    "insights-2019-02-11-spotlight-on-mel-specialists-in-abuja-nigeria": {
      "title": "Spotlight on MEL Specialists in Abuja, Nigeria",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "DevTech’s Monitoring &amp;amp; Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) specialists provide technical support to USAID and its implementing partners (IP) for the Nigeria Monitoring, Evaluation and learning (MEL) Activity. The activity goal is to transform USAID/Nigeria into a premier practitioner of program monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) rooted in a learning and adaptive culture.Under the guidance of the Senior M&amp;amp;E Specialists and the Chief of Party (COP), the specialists work with the MEL Activity’s Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) and other USAID technical staff to develop methods and systems needed to meet the deliverables required for M&amp;amp;E tasks. They are responsible for reviewing evaluation scopes of work, managing evaluations, analyzing and interpreting the results of surveys, and gathering data and doing analyses for assessments, evaluations, baselines, data quality assessments, and other M&amp;amp;E data efforts. The specialists also provide key expertise in the design and analysis of results and for capacity-building related to the Mission’s goal of furthering collaboration, learning, and adapting (CLA) internally and with its partners.While traveling to Abuja in November, I sat down with each of our MEL Specialists to talk a little about themselves and their professional backgrounds, how they became involved in M&amp;amp;E, what a typical day in the life of a MEL Specialist looks like, and what constitutes the most challenging aspects of the job, as well as the most rewarding.Rosemary Okafor – MEL Specialist for Peace, Democracy and Governance:Prior to joining DevTech in 2017, Rosemary was a Senior M&amp;amp;E Officer strengthening democratic Institutions in Nigeria. She holds a master’s degree in Public Administration from the University of Liverpool. When asked what a typical day looks like for her as a MEL Specialist for Peace, Democracy and Governance, she replied, “We do a lot of talking – collaborating, and sharing ideas.” From my time in the MEL Nigeria office, I can certainly attest that this is true – from doing data quality assessments, reviewing reports and deliverables, and meeting with implementing partners and USAID, to reviewing activity MEL plans, providing feedback on IP’s work plans, and even collaborating among fellow specialists – all specialists work in one room and constantly share ideas.I asked Rosemary what first interested her in M&amp;amp;E work.  She told me that while she was working as a program assistant at the National Democratic Institute on governance/elections projects, her supervisor noticed that she was always picking up details and metrics and took an interest in monitoring and evaluation. When the M&amp;amp;E position become vacant, the Chief of Party suggested she apply. From there, she became an M&amp;amp;E officer, then a senior officer, then a specialist. Rosemary explained that the most challenging part of her work is the constant pressure to improve.  For example, data quality assessments (DQAs) used to just be a checklist and now it’s comprised of lessons learned, next steps, putting context in reports, and demonstrating how your monitoring feeds into the data collected. Basically, it is all about providing better services and constantly improving what you do; she said that’s also the best part, stating, “You’re always learning from your colleagues who raise the bar and inspire each other to do more, and the fast-paced nature of the work keeps you motivated and striving for innovation.”Olufolake Akeju- Senior MEL Specialist for HIV/TB:Folake qualified 14 years ago as a medical doctor and brings more than ten years of experience in public health covering HIV/AIDS/TB clinical practice and as well as development projects on HIV/AIDS/TB; malaria; maternal, new born and child health; water, sanitation and hygiene; health systems strengthening, and governance. Folake holds a master’s degree in Public Health from the University of Sheffield, UK. After medical school, she did her year in hospital to get her license, then posted to another hospital for a year for mandatory national service. Folake originally planned on doing a masters of hospital administration but didn’t find a program she liked, so she decided to go for her Master of Public Health instead. The MPH program she chose had a health management and leadership component, and, after coming back to Nigeria, she noticed a lot of people with MPHs were working for development NGOs. Folake decided she was done with hospital work, and since M&amp;amp;E jobs were plentiful, she started at FHI 360, which was her first exposure to M&amp;amp;E. When asked what one of the biggest challenges is regarding her work, she mentioned that expectations sometimes don’t meet reality here – meeting the needs of the client and coordinating all the moving parts and all the different actors can make it challenging and unpredictable. Additionally, the industry is always changing and there’s always more to know about M&amp;amp;E! So far, the MEL Activity has been her favorite place to work, citing the good working environment and the relationship she has with her colleagues.Olufemi Gisanrin – MEL Specialist for Economic Growth and Environment:Femi is a Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Specialist, backstopping the Office of Economic Growth and Environment for the MEL Program. Femi brings over two decades of experience in private sector and development projects. Over the last decade, Femi has worked in M&amp;amp;E for USAID Agricultural development projects including MARKETS, Bridge to MARKETS II, and MARKETS II. Femi grew up on a farm, and even was part of a nationwide campaign promoting milk consumption in Nigeria as a child. He earned a degree in food technology and development and went on to work for a private Dutch company as a production manager. Because of his private sector background, he then came to work for Chemonics on their program staff. For the USAID Nigeria Maximizing Agricultural Revenue and Key Enterprises in Targeted Sites (MARKETS) project he served as a middle belt regional manager, when the COP called him into his office and suggested he become the M&amp;amp;E person for the project. Femi then became the M&amp;amp;E Director for the MARKETS II project.Throughout his entire career, product and data quality had always been a central focus, along with following a process. “Want good data? Need to follow a process.” Femi didn’t always see M&amp;amp;E as exactly what he wanted to do – he said that people often see M&amp;amp;E as policing people – but he was already accustomed to quality management and quality control.  He said, “The production of cheese and yogurt is the same thing as M&amp;amp;E work at its core: quality and process control. If you check the control points, your product is likely to be right.” According to Femi, “[One of the most rewarding aspects of the job is getting] a total picture about what’s happening about the activity.  You know what the people in the field are doing and what data is coming in, giving you really broad knowledge.” One of the advantages of working at Devtech is the opportunity to do M&amp;amp;E for everything, and, he added, “That’s the beauty of working in a MEL Activity as an M&amp;amp;E person, vs. a non-M&amp;amp;E project.”Mukhtar Ijaiya – MEL Specialist for Health, Population and Nutrition:Mukhtar Ijaiya has more than five years’ progressive experience in monitoring and evaluation, project performance management and measurements, and public health research. He specializes in Sexual and Reproductive Health, Family Planning and Maternal and Child Health, HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Orphans and Vulnerable Children program areas. Mukhtar joined DevTech from FHI360, Nigeria. He holds a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, and a Master of Science degree with distinction in Public Health from the Birmingham City University, UK. Like his colleague Folake, Mukhtar started out pursuing a career in Pharmacy but ended up in M&amp;amp;E. After obtaining his degree, Mukhtar did a year internship in pharmacy, followed by the one-year mandatory national service, then worked at a community pharmacy for six months. The internship turned out to be a very eye-opening experience, and he finished unsure if that was what he wanted to do. From there he made a pivot into public health. He had always been good with figures, metrics, and data and his first job after master’s was a mixed role – doing half M&amp;amp;E and half programmatic work – and he immediately knew what part he enjoyed the most.When asked what the most challenging part of his work as a MEL Specialist, he cited that there is no central national database and interfacing with a wide range of professionals in different program areas. But the most rewarding part, he added, “is when you see progress – being able to see when something is working, when you can see appreciable improvement in the lives and/or living conditions of the beneficiaries, and there is data to back it up.” Since getting involved in M&amp;amp;E, Mukhtar has seen things from a different perspective, stating that it “makes you more thorough” always asking, “When, How and Where did you get that information from?”Toyosi Adebambo – Acting Senior MEL Specialist for Systems:Unlike the majority of his colleagues, Toyosi had always hoped a career in M&amp;amp;E would be in his future, ever since earning a degree in mathematics and statistics from Federal Polytechnic in his home state of Osun. He has always loved statistics, working through calculations and problem solving, making a career in M&amp;amp;E seem appealing. After graduating University, Toyosi went on to work in a variety of fields (including owning his own restaurant!) prior to starting his M&amp;amp;E work with Society for Family Health Nigeria. When asked what the most exciting part of his job is, Toyosi cited the rise of “big data,” database management, and operations, and getting to be a part of something growing and innovative. He said, “There is no other position like this in the Mission, where we combine technology with M&amp;amp;E, and I am thrilled to be part of something unique.” When asked about the future of M&amp;amp;E in Nigeria, Toyosi responded, “M&amp;amp;E is everything – or MEL now, as the learning portion has been cut off for a very long time.

      "title": "New Government, Same Scenario: Bondholders Will Not Negotiate with Maduro",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "A few days after the second inauguration of Nicolás Maduro in early January 2019, a group of bondholders expressed their intention not to negotiate the delayed payments with the Venezuelan leader because the legitimacy of his new administration is in doubt. The international community has not recognized Nicolás Maduro as President after elections held last May (1). The bondholders claim that the only legitimate public body in Venezuela is the National Assembly, and they are willing to negotiate with the Venezuelan legislature to agree on a debt restructuring and an economic reform program.Looking ahead at 2019, Venezuela has gloomy economic prospects: a decline in economic activity of 5% is expected, with inflation of approximately 10,000,000% according to the IMF World Economic Outlook from October 2018, another new historical (negative) record on this variable. In terms of debt commitments, Venezuela must pay a total of US $8,975 million, of which US $5,116 million correspond to sovereign debt (Rendivalores.com).Hurtling toward collapse: New increases in the minimum wage and in the marginal reserveNicolás Maduro announced a new increase in the minimum wage on January 14. A 300% increase from Bs.S.4,000 to Bs.S.18,000, along with an increase of the same magnitude in the food ticket (cestaticket), bring the new integrated salary to Bs.S 19,500, or US $6.47 using the average weekly value of the reference exchange rate. Public and private salary tables were to be adapted beginning January 15, generating conflict in the various professional associations as these new measures are they would violate collective agreements. One of the sectors most affected by the measure has been the education sector. Teachers have engaged in marches and strikes. The Minister of Education, Aristóbulo Istúriz, admitted in an interview that the goal of adjusting salary tables is that all workers (both skilled and unskilled) receive the same remuneration. (See https://www.aporrea.org/actualidad/n337175.html; https://www.aporrea.org/trabajadores/n336727.html)As a measure to counteract the hyperinflation in the country and the continuous depreciation experienced by the parallel exchange rate, the Central Bank of Venezuela announced a 60% increase in the marginal legal reserve, which will mean that banks will be required to transfer resources to the main Venezuelan financial entity as reserves and will therefore have fewer resources to allocate to internal credit. However, it is worth noting that for the week of January 11, the monetary liquidity increased by 20.6% with respect to the balance registered at the end of 2018; the parallel dollar has depreciated by 272% since January 1, 2019 (Central Bank of Venezuela, DolarToday, own calculations).With the implementation of these measures, a worsening in the Venezuelan economic environment is expected, including as a greater acceleration in the growth of prices and more businesses forced to close due to their inability to adjust wages and lost access to low-cost financing (since in Venezuela the interest rates are regulated). The new credit restriction seriously compromises the profitability of the banking system and threatens a collapse.Financial markets react positively to the political conflict in VenezuelaSince the week of January 18, Venezuela’s external debt instruments have seen improved results after several months of generalized uncertainty and poor performance (Bloomberg, 7 + 7 Weekly Report of Banco Mercantil, own calculations). Sovereign bonds averaged an increase of 1.30 percentage points compared to the close of the previous week, with the bond maturing in 2026 experiencing the highest increase. State oil company PDVSA recorded an increase in its price of 1.66 percentage points, with the bond with expiration in 2022 performing best during the week.  On January 23, the prices of the sovereign bonds exhibited on average a significant increase of 6.76 percentage points with respect to the previous day; while the bonds of the state oil company PDVSA experienced a jump of almost 13 percentage points. This was also reflected in the decline in the country risk indicator for Venezuela, which fell that same day by 551 basis points, its steepest decline since November 10, 2017 (Rendivalores, Bloomberg, ámbito.com, own calculations).On Wednesday, January 23, in the midst of a massive march in the city of Caracas, the president of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, was sworn in as interim president of Venezuela on the basis of articles 233, 333 and 350 of the constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Hours after his inauguration, Guaidó said that he plans to hold talks with creditors to re-negotiate the foreign debt once he is internationally recognized as the legitimate president of Venezuela.Faced with a potential regime change in the medium or long term, IDB President Luis Alberto Moreno declared that the organization is willing to work with the newly established interim government in various economic development projects in the country (https://www.swissinfo.ch/spa/jefe-del-bid-se-dice-dispuesto-a-trabajar-con-el-presidente-interino-de-venezuela/44704114).Increasing national and international pressure: Venezuelan National Assembly and Brazil prepare new measures against the Venezuelan governmentAfter assuming presidency on the first day of 2019, the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, met with several leaders of the Venezuelan opposition in exile and the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS), to coordinate a series of concrete measures for the re-establishment of democracy in Venezuela. Although no details have been provided on the possible measures, it is expected that the measures will include diplomatic, economic, humanitarian support for Venezuelans who have migrated to Brazil.Meanwhile, during its January 15 session, the Venezuelan National Assembly requested that the governments of nations that do not recognize the legitimacy of the Maduro government prohibit any management of liquid assets of the Venezuelan State by the illegitimate Maduro government in accounts in their countries, in order to protect Venezuela’s assets abroad in the absence of recognition by the international community. It is reported that the Bank of England has prohibited Nicolás Maduro from handling US $1.2 billion in gold bullion belonging to Venezuela held by the institution, and on January 25 the provisional government of Juan Guaidó received authorization from the Federal Reserve of the United States to control and manage the assets of Venezuela protected in US banks.In addition, the legislative body also asked the governments of these nations to authorize accredited private banks to prohibit high-ranking officials of the Venezuelan government from handling funds, accounts and state assets established in their financial institutions.The knockout blow? US Department of the Treasury approves sanctions against PDVSA and compromises the future of MaduroNicolás Maduro’s regime is increasingly hanging by a thread. In the afternoon of January 28, Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, announced a series of sanctions against the state oil company PDVSA to increase pressure for the departure of the increasingly internationally isolated socialist leader, as well as reaffirming the support of the US government for the interim president of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. With these measures, the Maduro regime will not have access to the assets of the oil company, which are valued at approximately US $7,000 million, in addition to some US $11,000 million for lost oil export revenues from Venezuela to the United States (https://www.swissinfo.ch/spa/tesoro-eeuu-impone-sanciones-a-petrolera-venezolana-pdvsa–maduro-dice-son-criminales/44715584).However, the Secretary of the Treasury himself clarified that the US refineries (including CITGO) will continue normal activities, with their funds destined to a blocked account. He also clarified that these measures will not be permanent, but that they intended to pressure the Maduro regime to change its authoritarian behavior and to combat corruption in the oil company (https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm594).In addition to impairing financing to the Maduro regime, which will jeopardize its ability to pay its external obligations, this measure could end up finally bringing down the weakened Venezuelan economy by restricting the entry of foreign currency to the country for exports to the United States.Note:(1) The countries that did not publicly recognize Nicolás Maduro as president of Venezuela are: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Guyana, Saint Lucia, the United States, and the European Union, which is made up of 28 countries.",

      "title": "Lessons Learned Training 168 Data Collectors in a Developing Country",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "One cannot predict the circumstances that arise when implementing a project in a developing country. Undoubtedly, many issues related to the geographical, economic, and political spectrums of a country may contribute to the execution of a project and there is not a thorough manual for how to train a large group of data collectors. Despite the challenges that come to light during the implementation phase, it is imperative that the logistical preparation is conducted properly to ensure a successful training.In October 2018, the USAID/Zambia Education Data Activity trainees provided a two-week training workshop in Lusaka, Zambia, to train 168 data collectors. The training covered how to conduct Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and to how to use tablets to collect the baseline data of 15,108 Grade 2 students in 818 schools, including community-run and government schools.  These schools are located in five provinces: North Western, Eastern, Western, Southern, and Muchinga. There are seven different official languages spoken at each of the five provinces: Ichibemba, Chitonga, Ciyanja, Silozi, Luvale, Lunda, and Kiikoande. The Quality Control Officers and Assessors were assigned to one of the respected provinces based on their proficiency in at least one of the languages.Training a large group of data collectors has its challenges and it is important to keep in mind that technological failures can occur anytime: Projectors fail to turn on, computers used to track attendance and other logistical information crash, or a slow Internet connection delays a presentation. In order to prevent logistical nightmares, here are some key lessons learned from the field:      Training more data collectors than your sample target is crucial. Due to time constraints, if a data collector falls ill and can no longer partake in the training sessions or during the data collection period, it is important to have a replacement list of trained data collectors ready to partake in the training sessions or to be deployed to the field during the data collection period.        Determine what modes of transportation the data collectors will use to reach their assigned schools prior to their departure to the field. Then estimate the distance that each group of data collectors are to travel from one school to the other to determine the amount of funding needed to fulfill the trips. In the case of Zambia, the modes of transportation varied depending on the location of the schools. Some used cow-carts, boats or combination of the two in addition to walking to reach community schools in remote rural areas.        Field monitoring can be challenging, particularly when there are groups of data collectors in different parts of the country. Creating a group chat to communicate with the data collectors in real-time to relay important information and provide guidance when necessary is key for ensuring the data collection is completed on schedule.        Unlike paper surveys, tablets are more efficient way to collect and sync the data. However, in the training session during short breaks or when tablets are not in use, it is important to make sure that the tablet holders power off to save battery life. Otherwise, the organizers face the cumbersome work of charging an entire bank of 180 tablets overnight for the training session the next day.  ",

      "content"	 : "Maduro brings new cooperation agreements with RussiaDesperate for funding after restrictions, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro traveled to Russia on December 4th to meet with his counterpart, Vladimir Putin. In this meeting, the countries signed new agreements for US $6 billion to finance projects in the oil and mining sectors. The Venezuelan president said that US $5 billion will be used to finance projects in Venezuelan-Russian joint ventures with the objective of “raising oil production by almost 1 million barrels a day.” The remaining money will be used for gold mining projects. With this new loan, Russia has lent Venezuela US $23 billion between 2006 and 2018. The Russian government also confirmed that it will continue to provide support to Venezuela. (1)China increases influence in VenezuelaThe Chinese tech giant ZTE is providing the technology for the “Carnet de la Patria” (Fatherland Card) in Venezuela. The Fatherland Card is a national identity card that has been used as an instrument of social control by the government of Venezuela. It was inspired by a similar project implemented in China by ZTE that enables the Chinese government to monitor the social, political, and economic behavior of its citizens.The Fatherland Card was implemented in Venezuela in January 2017 and stores information such as date of birth, family information, employment and income, properties, medical history, state benefits, social networks, political party membership, and voting registries.According to the government, the objective of the card is to gather information about the socioeconomic status of the population and expedite the social assistance programs. To promote the card, the government provides handouts, cash bonuses, cheap groceries, discounted medical care, and subsidies for gasoline.(2)  However, the card has also become a tool of pressure for public employees, who are required to add this card in the Socialist’s Party registry.  It has also been used for purpose of electoral identification, although this use is ostensibly prohibited. (3)This is not the first time ZTE has provided services to the Government of Venezuela. In 2016, ZTE began to centralize the video surveillance system for the whole country, although this project was dropped due to financial constraints.Citgo under threat of embargo after payments from Venezuela have not materializedAttempts to forestall the Citgo embargo have failed. The Canadian mining company Crystallex International has annulled a US $1.4 billion expropriation agreement with the Venezuelan government that took place in 2011 because it violates the court order that allows the mining company to seize the shares of Citgo. Crystallex and Rusoro Mining (another Canadian company with an expropriation agreement with Venezuela) will force the auction of the refinery if the economic crisis and cash flow in Venezuela worsen.Venezuela is running out of oil and gasolineThe decline in Venezuela’s oil production is compromising the country’s ability to pay its creditors, mainly China and Russia, and generating fuel shortages in various regions of the country.  The shortage of gasoline is mainly attributed to refineries owned by PDVSA, the state oil company, working at less than 25% of their capacity.  According to the latest report from OPEC, oil production in Venezuela has decreased to 1.137 million barrels per day, its lowest level in 15 years. This underutilization of current infrastructure is a consequence of a lack of personnel and raw materials and technical deficiencies in the fuel supply chain. Mass resignation of personnel has resulted from deplorable working conditions and hyperinflation eroding purchasing power of salaries.  To address the shortfall in production, Venezuela has imported oil: Venezuela’s imports of crude oil and petroleum-derived products from the United States in over the first three quarters of 2018 registered an increase of 70% compared to the same period in 2017.Venezuela uses its oil to repay debts with creditors. Igor Sechin, president of the Russian state oil company Rosneft, met with Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro claiming delays in oil shipments to repay debts. Sechin showed that Venezuela maintained its compliance with shipments of oil to China but was short 380,000 barrels to Russia.Saudi Arabia will cover Venezuela’s production quota in OPECAccording to preliminary figures from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi Arabia has increased its oil production levels by 1.8%. According to cartel representatives, this increase is intended to compensate for the decrease in the contribution of Venezuela.Venezuela delivers economic data to the IMFTo avoid new sanctions that would imply the definitive end of external financing, the Venezuelan Central Bank provided the International Monetary Fund macroeconomic data corresponding to the year 2017. The data shows that the Venezuelan economy contracted 15.7% in 2017. This contraction is driven by shrinking in oil (15%), manufacturing (25%), and construction (53%). Inflation was estimated to be 860%. In 2016, the economy contracted 16.5% and inflation was 274%.For 2017, there is no data related to the balance of payments, liquid international reserve levels, net asset position, direct investment and portfolio flows, non-oil GDP growth, or monthly inflation levels. The government has not disclosed figures for 2018. However, the General reported the Venezuelan economy contracted by 29.8% in the third quarter of 2018, implying that Venezuela would have negative growth for the fifth consecutive year.Total closure for the Industrial Sector in 2019?December began with the closure of the tire manufacturer Goodyear in Venezuela. A union representative confirmed that the 400 employees of the multinational will not continue to work. Among the causes attributed to this closure are the difficulties in accessing raw materials, the rising production costs driven by the hyperinflation, and the significant decline in domestic demand as a result of the deep recession that has been in the country for the last five years.The closure of this company is a sign of what is to come. In a Quarterly Outlook Survey, the president of the Venezuelan Confederation of Industrialists Juan Pablo Olalquiaga pointed out that 700 companies stopped operations in Venezuela during the third quarter of 2018, representing 22% of the total number of companies that still operate in the country. The main reasons cited by respondents include the difficulties accessing domestic credit as a result of the new legal reserve applied to private banks and the generalized negative perception about whether the country outlook will improve in the medium-term. Olalquiaga also said that it is expected that at least 50% of the remaining small and medium active firms would close during the rest of 2018 and 2019.(4)Maduro decreed new minimum salary increasesNicolás Maduro decreed a new increase in the minimum wage of 150% (the fourth in 2018). The new minimum wage is Bs.S. 4,500 (USD $11.30) (5) and was to take effect in December 2018. In addition to the new increase in the minimum wage, the Venezuelan president also announced new transfers through social protection programs, which include pensions and Christmas bonuses.The previous minimum wage increase was in August 2018 and was followed by a hyperinflationary spiral. From August to October, inflation grew by 727.3%, (6) and the parallel exchange rate depreciated 400% monthly on average during this period. (7)  These numbers provide evidence that Maduro’s “Recovery, Growth and Economic Prosperity Program” has not helped to mitigate inflation nor generated confidence to reactivate the private sector. This program is characterized by being ambiguous, deeply ideological, and lacking economic foundations. We expect a deepening of the hyperinflation spiral, including a more aggressive depreciation rate, and closing of the few remaining small businesses and commercial establishments in the short run.(1) http://tass.com/economy/1034854(2) https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-29/what-s-the-card-of-the-fatherland-a-ticket-to-free-gasoline(3) http://www.venezuelaaldia.com/2018/04/12/tibisay-lucena-hablo-sobre-el-uso-del-carnet-de-la-patria-en-las-elecciones/(4)http://efectococuyo.com/economia/presidente-de-conindustria-asegura-que-han-cerrado-700-empresas-en-lo-que-va-de-2018/(5) November 29th 2018 exchange rate according to DolarToday.(6) Own calculations based on the National Consumer Price Index presented by the National Assembly of Venezuela.(7) Own calculations based on the statistical information of DolarToday.",

      "title": "Gender Budget Analysis as a Dynamic Tool to Improve Gender Mainstreaming",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "By Arwa Al-Najdawi, DevTech’s Gender Budget Expert on the USAID Jordan Fiscal Reform and Public Financial Management ProjectI had the opportunity to present a session at the International Consortium on Governmental Financial Management (ICGFM) 2018 Winter Training Conference that was held December 3-5, 2018, at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, DC. ICGFM, as the only worldwide grouping of organizations and people involved in governmental financial management, encourages its members to work together to promote a better understanding of professional financial management (PFM) among public officials at all levels of government. The theme for this year’s conference was “PFM in a Changing World.”In my presentation, I addressed the rationale for introducing gender budget analysis and the benefits that governments will gain by using this tool to:  Recognize the different roles/features/needs of women and men, and boys and girls in society  Recognize the economic situation and participation of women in the labor market  Formulate/reformulate gender-friendly public policies that target specific gender/vulnerable groups (poor, elderly, delinquent juveniles, or disabled persons)  Improve transparency and accountability towards gender commitments  Improve gender equity and equality in a specific area that leads to gender mainstreaming.Based on the outcomes of a survey conducted by UN Women on the assessment of gender equality implementations at the global level, all countries around the world have legal frameworks (constitution, laws, by-laws, etc.) and strategic plans for gender equality. Despite that fact, only 27% of world countries have a gender budgeting framework, and 14% of them have an overall implementation of gender budgeting instruments.To improve PFM performance from a gender perspective, I stressed the need to embed the public budget document with gender-relevant indicators. Gender performance indicators are highly recommended to track the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures that respond to both gender needs and requirements. Ultimately, this will lead to monitoring the progress/shortcomings in each specific area, providing policy makers and decision takers with evidence-based recommendations on gender needs and requirements in the society which will help to bridge any gender gaps.  I then demonstrated some of DevTech’s achievements in the area of gender budgeting for the USAID Jordan Fiscal Reform and Public Financial Management Project.  The major achievements are:  Introduced evidence-based analytical reporting tool on gender budgeting.  Assisted in drafting and delivering the first-of-its-kind gender budget analytical reports in four pilot ministries (Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Social Development, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Political and Parliament Affairs). This process will be scaled up in 2019 to cover an additional four pilot ministries (Ministry of Health, Ministry of Youth, Ministry of Justice, and Ministry of Municipal Affairs).  Provided technical assistance to the General Budget Department (GBD) in formulating a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to institutionalize the gender budgeting process in Jordan and serve their gender national priorities.Even though gender budgeting is a fiscal tool, I believe it is also an economic and social tool that should aim to improve citizen welfare.ICGFM VP of Programs and Conference Chair Mr. David Pearl and participants were impressed with the presented material. Many of them expressed their likes and comments by posting on LinkedIn:  “Thanks for the excellent presentation. ICGFM greatly appreciates DevTech sharing its expertise at the Winter conference”, David Pearl, VP of Programs and Conference Chair.  “Excellent presentation, Arwa. Mabrouk!”, Mark Gallagher, Ph.D., Macrofiscal Advisor, ICGFM Speaker &amp;amp; Participant.  “I echo Mark’s comments.  Public sector projects must have gender-focused activities that address the needs of women and girls to truly say they are gender sensitive”, Samuel Taddesse, Expert in Regional Development and Protection Programs.If you would like to know more, you can see the presentation here: [https://www.icgfm.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Day2-Sp4-Gender-Budget-Analysis_LewarneNajdawiCooper.pdf](https://www.icgfm.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Day2-Sp4-Gender-Budget-Analysis_LewarneNajdawiCooper.pdf)",

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "In 2008, USAID Mission in Kosovo rolled out the Kosovo Private Enterprise Program (KPEP). The program was awarded to Booz Allen Hamilton and its consortium of implementing partners — which included DevTech Systems. The goal of KPEP was “to stimulate private sector competitiveness of Kosovo’s economy.” At the time of the program design, Kosovo’s economy was only growing at approximately three percent and unemployment was at 40 percent. Challenges facing enterprises in the newly independent country included unreliable electricity supplies, insufficient transportation corridors, cost-prohibitive financing rates, and weak economic demand.In the context of the USAID Kosovo Strategic Plan 2010 – 2014, KPEP played a pivotal role. The program was designed to elevate impact by catalyzing transformational change for Kosovo’s economy through lasting improvements in private sector competitiveness. The program was broken down into four main components:  Support private sector in targeted sectors with potential for growth and competitiveness.  Identify demand-driven development for business support services.  Improve the business-enabling environment.  Workforce developmentFurthermore, KPEP also addressed several crosscutting areas, including gender, youth, and minority development.DevTech’s contribution in the preliminary stages of the program were in the workforce development component. DevTech specialists identified training gaps in critical economic sectors, and developed both short- and long-term intervention plans. The key sectors included agriculture, construction, forestry, ICT, tourism, recycling, metals, and decorative stone.As a whole, the program surpassed all of the key performance indicators developed under the Performance-Based Management System. Results included:  A total increase in sales across all enterprises. A target increase of 23.4 percent was set at the beginning of the project. The end result was over 50 percent growth in sales when compared to the baseline.  An increase in full-time equivalent jobs. With a target increase set at roughly 5,000 jobs, the end result was over 6,500 newly creation positions.  A cumulative increase in both exports and investment.DevTech strengthens the capacity of governments, businesses, and citizens to build open and sustainable economic systems that encourage growth and reduce poverty. We have proven experience helping local and national governments implement sound budget practices, carry out financial reforms, support small businesses, and establish effective economic policies and regulations. Our expertise in public financial management and fiscal sustainability as well as our work in education, gender, and youth, made us an ideal partner for Booz Allen Hamilton for this portion of the project. Our experience enabled us to provide key insight and crucial planning during the preliminary stages of this program.

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "With developments in global trade agreements and improvements in technology, international shipments of commodities play an increasingly crucial role in many countries’ economies. However, the United States has experienced millions of dollars in rejections at port due to the limited capacity of receiving nations to conduct accurate sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) tests of food commodities.The United States Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) addressed this matter by providing funding to training initiatives under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Laboratory Capacity Building Program. The program, which is implemented under the APEC Food Safety Cooperation Forum (FSCF), trains food specialists from APEC member countries on SPS testing to reduce false rejections and improve the overall capacities in the area of food safety testing. FAS, as part of a coalition of supporters, provided funding from FY 2011 to 2014 and commissioned DevTech Systems to evaluate its participation in the program.DevTech conducted a range of data collection activities, including:  Reviews of training curricula  Assessments of activities in online training websites  Face-to-face interviews with food safety professionals from APEC member countries.  DevTech’s assessment of online activity provided to-the-day information on hit counts, page visits, online training downloads, and other indicators of utilization of APEC web-based resources among food safety professionals in member countries.Through the evaluation, DevTech highlighted the creation of a community of practice among food safety specialists as a result of the program.  The training provided by the APEC initiative established a global network among industry professionals that significantly contributed to post-project sustainability. The outcome was also cost-effective, as the community was established virtually using web-based communications.Through the network, members have been able to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and best practices in food safety testing. DevTech identified additional improvements in stakeholder coordination to further improve program outcomes, but the organic development of a food testing community of practice established an environment of collaboration and learning that will greatly contribute to the sustainability of the program’s objectives.

      "content"	 : "Changes to the cryptocurrency “El Petro”In an attempt to keep the poorly received cryptocurrency “El Petro” alive, superintendent of Cryptoactives and Related Activities Joselít Ramírez announced on October 1 that the cryptocurrency would be the new commercial currency of Venezuela both nationally and internationally and would displace the use of the dollar as a means of payment for goods and services with allied countries.  All oil purchases with Venezuela are to be transacted using the Petro.A new white paper on the Petro further explains its operation and attributes. Its price will be calculated by using the sale price of oil (50%), gold (20%), iron (20%), and diamond (10%), although the authorities claim that it will remain anchored to the value of the Venezuelan oil basket. The document also states that the Petro may be purchased through the virtual exchange houses and the website of the Cryptoactive Treasury of Venezuela (TCV). It will have a discount of 3% for the first three issues and that the liquidation value of the Petro in any international currency will have an administrative rate of 5%. In addition, its usability is guaranteed for the the purchase of goods and services for private use, both nationally and internationally, the payment of taxes and public services, and sending remittances, among other uses.The Petro, even with its modifications, will continue to be dematerialized, and digitized money will be another fiduciary currency parallel to the bolivar and rather than a digital asset tradable with other cryptocurrencies or commodities.(1) Determination of the value of the Petro will be difficult, as the commodity basket is complicated and production of the included commodities production has declined significantly in recent years.Debt payment pressuresThe authorities’ interest in reviving the Petro may be motivated by a desire to convince or force Venezuelans to use the cryptocurrency in their international and even domestic transactions, given the government’s significant need for foreign currency to meet its obligations. A payment of $229 million for sovereign debt was due in September. Further debt service payments of $1,598 million for sovereign and PDVSA debt, interest, and amortization were scheduled in October. Venezuela made a $949 million interest payment on a PDVSA 2020 bond in late October.   Guaranteed by 50.1% of shares in the parent company of Citgo, the bond is the only type on which Venezuela has continued to make payments, which has allowed it to stave off a loss of control of Citgo and therefore potentially the total collapse of oil production for Venezuela.New economic announcements and the fate of PDVSA fate: More improvisation in an uncertain outlookOn October 16, the Sectoral Vice President of Economy Tareck El Aissami, announced that Venezuela will use the euro as the reference currency to carry out exchange transactions in the local market with an initial offer of 2 billion euros, in addition to allowing the participation of public and private banks in this auction system. The vice-president himself assured that the measure was implemented to counteract the effects of international sanctions that prevent transactions in US dollars of Venezuela with the rest of the world. The DICOM system has allocated about $107.38 million through late October 2018, representing a decline of 72.5% compared to 2017. This is another indication of the significant cash constraint the government is facing.The Venezuelan government has not shown signs of a credible opening of the exchange market. This is manifested in the continuous depreciation of the parallel exchange rate, which has already reached the Bs. S 200 barrier from an initial value of 60 Bs. S at the beginning of the economic plan last August. Nor has it presented an economic plan to combat hyperinflation, which according to the International Monetary Fund could close the year 2018 at 2,500,000%, a figure without precedent in the economic history of Venezuela. This reflects the significant use of the inflationary tax to finance the fiscal deficit (at least its domestic part), which is expected to continue given the lack of significant access to international markets.In the same announcements by the sectoral vice-president, it was decided by decree to increase the legal reserve of the banking system from 31% to 40%. In addition, greater price controls and sanctions are placed on entrepreneurs and traders who practice “speculation.” These measures fuel the poor credibility of the current policies, since they reflect the lack of corrective macroeconomic measures, such as limiting monetization of the fiscal deficit or fiscal policy measures, that are compatible with their objective of “zero fiscal deficit” as announced in August.The government also has not been able to articulate, together with fiscal and monetary policies, a set of policies in industrial, agricultural and commercial matters such as tax incentives, reforms in the legal framework and personal security to reactivate the economic activity that could close this year with a decrease of 18%.Looking to ChinaIn mid-September, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro travelled to the People’s Republic of China. The Chinese government granted a loan of $5,000 million, which according to unofficial sources will be used to finance projects by Chinese companies established in Venezuela. This new commitment represents a figure less than the amount of interest and amortization due in 2018, which amounts to $6,400 million.In late October, the Venezuelan government invited experts China to a conversation about economic policies to reactivate a depressed internal productive apparatus. The Minister of Agriculture and Lands, Wilmar Castro Soteldo, consulted the Chinese experts on the control mechanisms that the government of China exert on its economy. To the surprise of the Venezuelan minister, the invited expert responded on national television that in his country almost all of the companies that operate are private, and that the government is responsible for implementing incentives like subsidies, a more flexible legal framework and adequate infrastructure to make these companies are more productive and competitive, and not imposing controls on prices, salaries, salaries, profit margins, among others.(2)New fate for a broken PDVSA?Given the insolvency situation, cash flow crisis, and corruption scandals of the state oil company PDVSA, the National Constituent Assembly is considering the possibility of liquidating PDVSA to into a corporation, together with the electricity sector, called the Venezuelan Energy Corporation (CVE, its Spanish acronyms). This new entity, in addition to absorbing all the administrative, operational and physical assets (including the Citgo refinery) of the state company, would be authorized to develop export-oriented energy projects on its own and through joint ventures with foreign partners. This new corporation could represent a government strategy to reduce the impact of a possible Citgo collapse and to divide liabilities.Some analysts warn that this action could generate a series of lawsuits and lawsuits against the state oil company and the Venezuelan government, since its dissolution is intended to transfer all of PDVSA’s assets to the new corporation and eliminate its financial unpaid liabilities (which amount to $2,374 million as of October 12). This would further hurt the credit reputation of the country and may lead to new financial sanctions.Budget for 2019: When opacity is the lawOn October 23, the budget bill for fiscal year 2019 was presented to the National Constituent Assembly for an amount of Bs. S 1,529,780 million. This represents an increase of 323.74% with respect to the budget allocated for fiscal year 2018, which was Bs. S 361,021 million. On this occasion, no further details were given about the total amount of the Venezuelan budget, the price of the oil barrel of reference to estimate the income from hydrocarbons, the classification of fiscal revenues (oil and non-oil), nor other sources of income, destination of the same, or sources of internal and foreign financing.  As in other recent years, an explanatory memorandum of the bill was also not presented. The explanatory memorandum typically contains economic data, growth targets and limits on indebtedness. This pattern increases the opacity and lack of credibility in the Venezuelan government.(1) This implies a violation of Article 318 of the Venezuelan Constitution, which states that the only legal tender is the bolivar.(2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAVIdQDypSI",

      "content"	 : "Visualizing our Way to SuccessOn October 22nd, DevTech sent five staff to the annual Tableau Software Conference in New Orleans, LA. The conference consists of three jam-packed days where 16,000 data visualization professionals participated in hands-on trainings, breakout sessions, keynote speakers, and data-focused activities.The Tableau Software gives DevTech the ability to manipulate data into stunning and interactive charts, graphs, and maps, which can be easily accessed online. DevTech uses Tableau to produce data analyses for the Analytics Data Visualization and Information Services (ADVISE) project for USAID globally, and the Support for Strategic Information and Project Management Services (S4SIPMS) project for USAID/Nigeria.Not only did DevTech staff interact with other companies and organizations using Tableau, they completed hands-on trainings, such as “Dazzling Dashboards; Finesse your Format,” “Top of the Table (Winning Table Calcs),” “Stack the Deck Utilizing Tabjolt (and other performance tools),” “Tableau + Python = &amp;lt;3,” and “R… You Ready? Jedi stats with R and Tableau.” These 2.5-hour training sessions allowed DevTech staff to follow guided lessons from Tableau professional staff, while practicing on the provided laptops and Tableau files. Some of the tasks that were learned included “set actions,” which is a new feature in Tableau that allows for benchmarking or showing a few selected countries in context. Other skills learned included cluster analysis with R and Python, performing advanced table calculations, and developing advanced charts such as sunbursts. These sessions were extremely helpful to the growth and development of the skills of DevTech staff.“The Tableau 2018 Conference was my first hands-on introduction to the software and I was blown away by all of the functionalities in Tableau,” said Meredith Kerrigan, DevTech Monitoring &amp;amp; Evaluation Associate. “I am very excited to keep learning and improving my abilities – in fact I have already developed a dashboard based on newly collected data and have shared it with one of my projects.”Additional sessions called “Brain Dates” were available, that allowed Tableau participants to meet one another and share ideas. DevTech analyst Srivani Valluru attended one of these sessions where she discussed the implementation of Tableau at USAID with other practitioners.Throughout the week, the conference provided opportunities for DevTech staff to hear from keynote speakers and attend events focused on Tableau analysis. During “Devs on Stage,” DevTech was able to learn from the Developers of Tableau about the new Tableau features, from “Vector maps” to “Multiple table storage for extracts,” enabling our team stay on the cutting edge of Tableau usage. During the Iron Viz Championship – a competition where three Tableau experts each built a visualization in front of the 16,000 conference attendees in only 20 minutes – our team was able to gain ideas for new visualizations that we will use in the future for our clients.DevTech staff attended breakout sessions that were designed to introduce new concepts to Tableau users and help them refine their existing work. Two attendees went to the “Practical Guide to Guided Analytics” session, which provided tips on how to format a visually compelling dashboard. Overall, the five DevTech staff attended a total of 36 (1) hands-on trainings and breakout sessions, three keynote speakers, and multiple data-focused activities. Moving forward, DevTech staff will use the skills and lessons learned at the Conference to improve upon their visualizations and create even more impactful products for DevTech’s clients.“The conference spanned everything about this software—from the most basic, minute functionalities to the parts of Tableau that push the boundaries of what we can do with computers. Each session was presented with an infectious, earnest energy that was unapologetically passionate about data visualization, which reminded me vividly of the ADVISE team,” commented Robindra Banerji, DevTech Data Analyst (Economist), ADVISE. “The ten sessions I selected cover most of the data analysis functionalities there are in Tableau, and I’m especially looking forward to sharing level of detail calculations with the Foreign Aid Explorer team, since we deal with data along several aggregable dimensions.”(1) Some sessions were counted twice as they were attended by multiple individuals.",

      "title": "DevTech Project Spotlight: Evaluation of the USAID/Zambia Education Program",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "In the early 21st century, the Government of Zambia (GOZ) and the Ministry of Education (MOE) recognized the vital role that education plays in youth development, poverty alleviation, and economic growth. In an effort to improve their education system, they took a number of steps to advance access for children across the country, including eliminating school fees. Despite these efforts, they found themselves constrained by funding issues, the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and the general challenges of making primary education free. This is when the USAID/Zambia Education program evolved. From 2003 to 2009, the program grew exponentially both in scale and investment.The primary role of USAID/Zambia was to collaborate with the Zambian MOE and provide support for the government’s efforts regarding increasing access, improving the quality of the learning environment, and enabling the MOE to promote their education sector agenda. In 2009, USAID contracted the DevTech team to conduct an independent assessment of the education program’s impact and to make recommendations related to strategy, programming options, and investments for the next five years.DevTech’s monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) experts spent six weeks in Zambia utilizing six complementary, interrelated forms of gathering information to conduct their assessment. These information gathering methods included individual and group interviews, focus group discussions, school visits, classroom observations, conversations with local citizens,meetings with MOE personnel, and the administration of anonymous questionnaires to individuals and groups of people involved with the program activities.Our evaluation team conducted:  A summative evaluation of the three largest USAID-funded education programs.  A sectoral evaluation that assesses the synergies among projects for affecting overall program sub-sectors such as teacher training and information management systems.The findings of the evaluations revealed:  There have been a number of positive developments resulting from USAID’s support in the education sector in Zambia. These positive developments include major education and enrollment gains, the development and distribution of high quality teacher’s manuals and learning materials, and heightened parent, guardian, and community participation in educational services.  Moving forward, the sustainability of USAID-funded efforts to support community schools will be dependent on the transition of the GRZ being able to assume full responsibility for these schools. Until that transition is complete, continued support for the volunteer efforts that keep these schools functioning is necessary to sustain the momentum of communities who may be beginning to show signs of fatigue.DevTech promotes safe, inclusive, and effective learning environments by working with government leaders and international partners to broaden education and training opportunities for children, at-risk youth, and adults. We have proven experience designing, supporting, and evaluating major education, gender, and youth projects around the world. Our expertise in monitoring and evaluation intersects with our education, gender, and youth practice through our skilled technical evaluations, enabling us to handle the assessment of USAID/Zambia Education Program with efficiency and accuracy.

      "content"	 : "We will be participating in the 32nd Annual American Evaluation Association conference, Evaluation 2018, in Cleveland, Ohio, from October 21 through November 3, 2018.  DevTech Director of Monitoring and Evaluation, Dr. Reuben Hermoso, will be presenting a roundtable session on November 3rd with Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Associate, Julia P. King, on the subject, “East Africa Collective Impact Evaluation of Countering Violent Extremism Programs.”The conversation will focus on the quasi-experimental impact evaluation (IE) which the Department of State’s Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations (CSO) is conducting, in partnership with DevTech, and how this IE will be used to help understand the impact of Countering Violent Extremism  (CVE) programming on strengthening and securing communities.Within the field of conflict, security, and development, the impact of CVE programming is not well understood. Although the use of rigorous data collection methods to measure the impact of single interventions is increasing, it is still extremely rare to measure the strategic effects of a group of CVE interventions in a specific country or region. DevTech has designed an IE to measure the overall impact of 18 CVE programs in Kenya and Tanzania under the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund (CTPF). The evaluation assesses regional progress against identified CVE indicators that measure communities’ risk for or resilience to violent extremist (VE) activity and recruiting, including measures of socio-economic inequality, religious and ethnic conflict, good governance, political freedom and participation, and social cohesion. This evaluation focuses on both determining the overall strategic-level impact of the cumulative CTPF activities on the above indicators and identifying recommendations for future CVE programming in the region.Dr. Hermoso and Ms. King will share their experiences of conducting this CVE impact evaluation, as well as lessons learned.DevTech will also be exhibiting at booth #6 on November 1st and 2nd.

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "When organizations approach monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E), it is often from the standpoint of compliance: Certain regulations require performance assessments for development projects, which require collecting and evaluating multiple kinds of data and information.  In my opinion, however, this is not the most important driver of the value of M&amp;amp;E.  Rather, it is the picture of accomplishment that M&amp;amp;E practices deliver.When this picture is based on high quality, reliable data and rigorous evaluation driven by a deep understanding of local contexts and conditions as well as economics, statistics, and social science research, it becomes compelling.  And compelling data drives social change.  How does this work?  An accurate picture of accomplishment lets program managers see how effective they have been.  I would argue that understanding this effectiveness enhances commitment to the cause, because knowing something factually reinforces belief.Let’s say your goal is to increase early reading outcomes, such as the CARS program in Nicaragua.  How do you know the program is effective?  For one, you can count the number of books that have been provided to school and teachers who have earned a diploma in improved active teaching-learning methodologies. Then, take it a step further.  Look at what students have produced, for example, a puppet show about child trafficking on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua.  The performance was designed and produced by a group of young student beneficiaries from the Community Action for Reading and Security (CARS) Activity funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) implemented by DevTech Systems, Inc.After watching the CARS video and seeing tangible impacts the program is having, I would challenge you NOT to be more committed to this cause.Whether it is educating children, reducing the instances of malaria due to better vaccination, or reducing violent extremist recruitment and activity in targeted communities, M&amp;amp;E plays a valuable role in bringing the right information to arguments about policy.  Furthermore, we are currently bombarded with messages about the challenges the developing world faces, and it is easy to succumb to fatigue and even cynicism. Data-driven pictures of accomplishments will re-energize the teams of people dedicated to improving human development and provide the tools organizations and governments need to influence policy and create positive social change.",

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Puerto Rico is currently facing one of the worst financial crises in its history with more than $123 billion in debt and pension obligations. With financial reporting being a core requirement of PROMESA (the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act enacted by the US Government that established an Oversight Board), action by the Commonwealth needed to be taken. In order to improve the transparency and accountability of the Commonwealth’s debt restricting activities, the Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority (FAFAA) created the Puerto Rico Macro-Fiscal Project.In September 2016, the FAFAA awarded DevTech the project. Since the project start and continuing today, the DevTech Team has worked on a number of task orders. These include developing economic growth projections for the Oversight Board based on the fiscal plan and the budget, providing legal and policy analysis support for the Commonwealth as necessary, and developing tools such as macroeconomic indicators, financial reporting templates, and creditworthiness assessments of the Puerto Rico Power Authority (PREPA) and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA). DevTech continues to work closely with the FAFAA to create a macro-fiscal framework and other key economic indicators that illustrate the country’s economic context. Recent milestones include:  The establishment of a baseline upon which the Commonwealth can build financial projections. Our experts assisted with the design and delivery of a benchmarking analysis that allows for evaluation the Commonwealth’s revenue collections and expenditures relative to the 50 states.  Through comprehensive Macro-fiscal modeling, the DevTech team has generated baseline projections for the Commonwealth’s first Fiscal Plan in 2017 as well as projections for the New Fiscal Plan in 2018 following the strike of Hurricane Maria. The modeling has allowed the Commonwealth to identify and evaluate potential measures that it can pursue to achieve sound fiscal management and economic sustainability.  The design of a high frequency macroeconomic “scorecard” that is included in the Government’s reporting package. This technical assistance helps provide increased financial transparency, reporting, and accountability.  The development of indicator tables that demonstrate the Commonwealth’s fiscal situation across multiple levels of government. These models were augmented to fit the economic environment of Puerto Rico and provide a valuable resource to help the Commonwealth detail the transfers from the federal government and the resulting improvement of the fiscal position as well as deficit concepts.  Creation of fan chart-based economic forecasts for the U.S. Treasury and the PROMESA Federal Oversight Management Board in 2016 on behalf of Puerto Rico, for discussing a Federal crisis response. This work benefited from DevTech principals’ research on stochastic forecasting frameworks that reflect innovative approaches relative to the contemporaneous forecasts of institutions.  Critical reviews of the creditworthiness of the water and electricity companies of Puerto Rico (PRASA and PREPA), both of which hold their own debt and have entered into their own parallel restructuring program. DevTech conducted a comprehensive review of these utilities, which involved understanding their internal deficiencies, such as inadequate public prices for their services or insufficient investment as well as the system of inter-governmental relations.DevTech has proven expertise modernizing government systems and assisting with the creation of more transparent and efficient financial and fiscal policies. Our assistance to local and national governments has included the creation of market intelligence and competitiveness units to foster small and medium enterprise (SME) participation in international markets, as well as supporting foreign ministries of finance to improve and modernize tax policy and administration. Our analytical capability also informs several economic and social databases that supply essential information to governments and development professionals worldwide. This extensive expertise has allowed us to help ease Puerto Rico’s crisis by contributing to the development of the fiscal plan and assessment of measures that it may potentially pursue to alleviate the crisis.

      "content"	 : "There is no instruction manual or guide for being good fathers and mothers, but through the Community Action for Reading and Security (CARS) Activity, which is implemented by DevTech Systems, USAID has developed accompaniment and training work for parents and caretakers through monthly gatherings called the “Parents’ Schools” (EPM).  In the past nine months, 5,000 people have participated in the EPMs in Nicaragua’s Caribbean region.The idea of the Parents’ Schools is to provide a place where families share and exchange knowledge and experiences to strengthen their child-raising practices and, above all, become more involved in their children’s process of learning to read.  Issues that are discussed in the EPMs include the importance of children’s education, the rights of children, the importance of communication in the family, gender violence, and trafficking.EPMs in ActionAracely Castillo Rivas is the mother of Loany and Alondra, both of whom are studying in the third level of preschool.  Alondra has a moderate psycho-motor disability. Although the little community school in Sahsa, North Caribbean, opened its doors to her and four other children with disabilities, the teacher couldn’t attend them as they needed, as she also has 40 other students in her classroom. Recognizing this, Aracely has gotten involved and now directly supports the education of her two children in the classroom.“I didn’t have the opportunity to even finish primary school,” said Aracely Castillo.  “My family was very poor and we changed our community every year.  That’s why my husband (a farmer) and I have proposed that our children have a better future.  We’re also learning in the EPMs how we can improve our children’s education and security.”Silvia Mena is the teacher who works with Aracely’s children. She admires and is grateful for this mother’s support.  “Aracely is a very special mother. She walks more than 30 minutes to bring her children to class, then stays to support me all morning, not just attending to her daughter Alondra, but also helping with the other children,” explains the teacher.  “She participates in everything and is the first to show up at the EPMs developed in the school.”This year, Aracely, together with other parents and caregivers of the students in Sasha’s school, have participated in training about the transition from preschool to primary, where they learned to develop very simple and fun learning activities in reading and writing with their children.",

      "content"	 : "The Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network (MFAN) and Publish What You Fund (PWYF) have analyzed the two most prominent U.S. Federal foreign aid reporting data platforms in connection with the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act (FATAA). That act called for the State Department and USAID to consolidate data collection and web platforms in order to improve US aid transparency.  MFAN today issued a call underscoring the need for the two agencies to commit to a single platform*.DevTech developed and currently manages one of the two data platforms, the USAID’s Foreign Aid Explorer (FAE, www.explorer.usaid.gov), under the USAID Data Services contract, which manages some of USAID’s most important data systems. The MFAN and PWYF analysis found that overall, USAID’S FAE platform dominates ForeignAssistance.gov, with strengths in nine of the ten criteria, including providing better verified and complete data. The analysis pointed to two strengths (out of a total of ten possible criteria) for FA.gov - timelier appropriations data.The Foreign Aid Explorer and its corresponding Foreign Aid Database (FADB) serve as the basis for the U.S. Government’s annual reporting of foreign assistance data to Congress (the “Greenbook”), as well as its annual reporting to the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It contains all official US foreign assistance data from 1946 to the present.MFAN and PWYF’s analysis recommends that USAID’s Foreign Aid Explorer (FAE) serve as the basis of a single, unified, solution for US Government foreign assistance reporting. Specifically, MFAN and PWYF call for the establishment of a consolidated data solution that “builds upon [USAID’s Foreign Aid Explorer] existing data and well-established data collection processes” while at the same time “incorporates missing functionalities and identifies incomplete data.”DevTech’s work with USAID over the past 25+ years demonstrates our commitment to providing the U.S. Government and the public with transparent, accurate, and compelling data on foreign assistance. We are constantly seeking to improve this important service and consolidate data not just across USAID Offices and Bureaus but across USG Agencies and Departments as a whole. MFAN and PWYF’s analysis highlights the need for collaborative work across the USG to identify best practices in data management and implement a consolidated data solution.  DevTech stands ready to be part of this solution.For more information about DevTech’s EADS work please click here.*The full MFAN-Publish What You Fund analysis can be found here, and a more detailed analysis here.",

      "title": "Monitoring and Evaluation Produce Benefits Beyond Their Findings and Recommendations",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Too often, project managers welcome evaluations with the same enthusiasm they give to an IRS audit of their tax filings. They think: Evaluations take away time from critical project implementation activities.  Evaluations – if the rule of thumb is followed that five percent of project costs should be budgeted for monitoring and evaluation – consume resources that could be used to expand programs to reach more beneficiaries. And, project managers recognize, evaluation reports often end up on the shelves or in the files, never doing anybody any good.  At best, to many project managers, evaluations are a necessary evil.These views reflect a misunderstanding of the full range of contributions that evaluations can make to project management. Of course, mid-term performance evaluations can be extremely helpful in making project or program design corrections when findings point to deficiencies that need to be remedied.  Final impact evaluations can also be invaluable in designing next-generation projects or reforming policies to achieve better returns from development resources.  In fact, mid-course corrections of on-going projects and redesign of programs and policies resulting from findings of final project evaluations are the main reasons for budgeting time and money to conducting monitoring and evaluation activities.But the contributions of M&amp;amp;E activities can be much broader than the findings they generate about project performance and impact.  M&amp;amp;E activities play an important “carrot and stick” role in ongoing day-to-day project management dynamics as well. Specifically, three important contributions of M&amp;amp;E to project management operations are:  Staff discipline from knowing that someone is watching:  The fact that staff – technical and clerical alike – know they are being watched during project monitoring and measured during project evaluation introduces an element of discipline and focus into their work. It is human nature.  Don’t we all brush a little harder in the weeks just before going to the dentist or exercise a bit more regularly to lose some pounds before our annual physical or before summer swimsuit season?  A major part of each of these events – visits to the dentist, doctor, or the even the beach – involves monitoring or evaluation, in this case of our physical condition or appearance. The same applies to project management.  Project managers want to look good.  So, they work harder to achieve project objectives and to keep documentation of project accomplishments in neat order for the next visit by monitors or evaluators.  In short, project management is a combination of good cop, bad cop, where the M&amp;amp;E staff became an external tool (bad cop) to assist project directors (good cops) keep their team members focused and responsive.  Recognition of work performed: People naturally like to have someone take an interest in their work and highlight their contributions to the team and accomplishments as individuals.  M&amp;amp;E provides that recognition when it shines a light on project accomplishments and disseminates findings of work well conducted. People are more motivated to perform well when someone takes interest in their work, when their work received attention beyond the confines of the activities for which they are directly responsible. However, those conducting monitoring or commissioning evaluations need to take measures to assure that M&amp;amp;E findings are indeed shared, particularly as feedback to those who are being monitored or evaluated.  On-the-job learning: Often projects are implemented at multiple locations or project sites spread across a wide geographic area of a country or region within a country.  Project staff working at one site are often not fully aware of what project staff are doing in other site locations, or how their colleagues “over the mountain” are solving some of the problems they also are encountering. Project monitoring staff and evaluation teams can promote information sharing across project locations as part of their work. Monitors and evaluators become the intellectual pollinators of ideas or solutions to problems confronting project staff in all locations. Evaluators play this role most effectively when, during their data gathering, they ask, “Are you aware of how your colleagues ‘over the mountain’ are addressing this problem or meeting that target?”  Evaluators also play a critical role in assessing the extent to which project staffs across all site locations are adopting uniform definitions of what they are reporting and using standard measures of the changes they are tracking in their reporting. In this way, evaluators help identify common weaknesses of project implementation and share this knowledge in their evaluation reports in ways that identify best practices that all sites can adopt and follow.In summary, M&amp;amp;E, when well administered, is an ongoing management tool, not just a one-time snapshot of how projects are working or what they have accomplished. Monitoring and evaluation are at the center of project management dynamics and the “nerve center” of project activities that is constantly providing feedback to incentivize improved management performance at all levels of project operation.",

      "content"	 : "This blog is a summary of a more detailed article, which you can download here: Venezuelan Economic Policy Announcements.pdf.Current conditions in VenezuelaThe DevTech Debt Restructuring Team recently visited Caracas and witnessed conditions on the ground. Everyday life is becoming impossible for the lower strata of the income distribution. The National Survey of Living Conditions (Encuesta Nacional de Condicionnes de Vida, or ENCOVI) reported an average of weight loss of 11 kilograms (22 pounds) in 2017, following an average loss of eight kilograms (16 pounds) in 2016.Basic services like banking, electronic payments, electricity, fixed and mobile telephony, water, and transportation present significant deficiencies, ranging from rationing to the complete suspension of supply, negatively affecting the quality of life of citizens. The availability of products in the market is higher compared to previous years, partly due to the increasing flow of remittances following massive migration, mixed remuneration strategies of some companies (for example paying a portion of wages in USD), and an implicit relaxation of the price controls policy. However, given the current policy mix, the situation will soon worsen.Real GDP has contracted by 35 percent since Hugo Chávez’s death in 2013. During this period, hyperinflation has set in, with accelerating annual inflation rates that regularly reach three digits.Against this backdrop, the President of Venezuela has dictated a set of new policy measures:Beginning in August 2018, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has made a series of announcements introducing new economic policies.  The new policies attempt to create a policy framework which supports economic recovery.Currency ConversionIn August, the “sovereign bolivar” replaced “strong bolivar.”  One sovereign bolivar is equal to 100,000 strong bolivars, effectively devaluing the currency by 96 percent.  The sovereign bolivar is anchored to the “petro” cryptocurrency, a cryptocurrency developed by the Venezuelan government. The Venezuelan government claims the petro is backed by reserves of natural resources, mainly oil, as an alternative to circumvent the sanctions imposed by the US government since August 2017. Its base price is the equivalent of the price of a single Venezuelan oil barrel, which is defined by the Venezuelan Ministry of Petroleum and Mining. This cryptocurrency is meant to be the fluctuating unit of account that will serve to fix the value of labour and that of the prices of consumer goods and services.The potential for the petro to be a real cryptocurrency relies on its liquidity in the market, but so far, the government has not been able to increase the demand for the instrument.A “conversion bonus” of 600 sovereign bolivars will be paid via the national identity card “el Carnet de la Patria.” This is a direct transfer associated with the currency conversion and is estimated to benefit some 10 million inhabitants.Minimum WageA new salary system will establish the minimum wage at 1,800 sovereign bolivars for public and private sector employees, and 1,350 for adolescents, effective September 1, 2018. This is the ninth minimum wage increase carried out by the Venezuelan government since 2017. The Venezuelan government will assign direct subsidies to the payroll of the small and medium-sized Venezuelan companies with the objective of minimizing the inflationary impact on the purchasing power of the workers. This represents significant implementation difficulties and will impose significant risks to the private sector, since for employees to receive payments they will need to register with the government and provide detailed information about the company.In addition, the complementary food voucher (Cestaticket) was adjusted up to 180 sovereign bolivars , which is equivalent to 10 percent of the minimum wage[1].Fiscal DeficitHead of State Maduro also announced a fiscal plan called “fiscal deficit equal to zero”, which will consist of increases in Value Added Tax and increases in income tax rates and the frequency of required payments.Currency AuctionsThe government will restore inter-bank foreign exchange currency auctions, last used in 2002, where the Central Bank auctions foreign reserves to the banking sector. On September 3, President Maduro announced that the petro will be part of the auctions of the DICOM Currency Allocation System starting in October.  It is expected that auctions will be carried out daily, with the objective of stabilizing the economy with a market exchange rate, thus displacing the parallel market.Gasoline PricesPresident Maduro announced a plan to reduce fuel subsidies in order to curb smuggling of inexpensive Venezuelan gasoline to neighbouring countries.  It is estimated that around $10 billion is lost annually from the smuggling of gasoline to Colombia.Venezuelans who hold the national identity card, el Carnet de la Patria, will continue to receive direct subsidies for two years.  For those without a national identity card, the price will rise to international levels. The final price has not been determined.Gold Savings PlanA national savings plan was launched: certificates backed by gold ingots of 1.5 and 2.5 grams respectively are available to all Venezuelans. The gold will be held by the Central Bank of Venezuela. The plan is also available in petros.Restructuring of MinervenFaced with the complaints of corruption, President Maduro also announced the total restructuring of the General Mining Company of Venezuela (Minerven), attached to the Corporación Venezolana de Guayana (CVG), with the objective of increasing gold production in the country.Ministry of Internal TradeA Ministry of Internal Trade was created to govern the domestic market.International Road ShowExecutive Vice President Delcy Rodríguez embarked on an international business tour with the purpose of presenting investment opportunities in Venezuela. At the same time, President Maduro invited Shell International to carry out its operations in Venezuela.Special ReservesA new requirement for financial entities to maintain additional reserves aims to prevent the financial system from granting credits which would be used to buy dollars in the parallel market, using the money that the Venezuelan State deposits for the payment of salaries. Nevertheless, this measure will force banks to use all their surplus reserves, which will lead to an expansion of domestic credit, which in turn implies an increase in monetary liquidity in the economy, accelerating inflation even more.Exchange RegimeOn September 7, the Minister of Economy and Finance, Simón Zerpa, and the president of the Central Bank of Venezuela, Calixto Ortega Sánchez, announced that a floating exchange rate and free convertibility of the currency scheme will be adopted throughout the national territory.The Central Bank of Venezuela will be in charge of governing and administering the new exchange regime, and authorities claim that they will allow the purchase and sale of dollars “without any restrictions,” where the price of the American currency fluctuates freely “according to supply and demand.”ConclusionsThese policy announcements fail to outline a clear path towards stabilization. Revenues will be insufficient and quickly eroded by hyperinflation, while expenditures are expected to continue to rise (financed by the Central Bank). The private sector will be unable to afford the wage increase, as there are neither increases in productivity nor external resources, like foreign currency inflows in the form of loans or aid, to support the increase.  The Central Bank will continue to print money to finance the fiscal deficit, further accelerating Venezuela’s economic decline.  The International Monetary Fund forecasts an economic decline of 15 percent and inflation of 1,000,000 (one million) percent are expected this year.Note[1]  This implies that the food bonus experienced an increase of 820 percent with respect to the value on July 1, 2018. In addition, this increase ignores the indexation that the supplement to wages used to have with respect to the unit of account for tax purposes (“Unidad Tributaria”), and instead it became a fixed value whose fixation will depend exclusively on what the Venezuelan Head of State announces.",

      "content"	 : "Punjab is Pakistan’s largest province, accounting for 74 million of a national population of 132 million in 1998; it is also the country’s wealthiest, with a share of 52 percent of the economy. However, the incidence of poverty is the second highest in all of Pakistan—more than 19 percent in 2013. As a result, economic inequalities within different classes of households and between urban and rural areas have risen, inducing wide variations across districts and along the urban/rural and gender divide. Additionally, quality of, and subsequent use of and faith in government services such as family planning (10 percent), basic health units (30 percent), veterinary services (17 percent), agriculture extension (15 percent), and 5 policing (9 percent) is even lower than the extremely low national average.Since 2013, World Bank has worked to implement The Punjab Public Management Reform Program (PMRP), an activity designed to support transparency, results-based management, e-governance, and creation of fiscal space, through the improvement in management of key departments and the removal of information barriers to accessing services.DevTech’s monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) experts worked to assess the performance of PRMP as the project reached its final year by utilizing a highly qualified team that effectively carried out essential evaluation tasks to improve transparency, and performance, and resource management of targeted departments of the Province of Punjab. While current evaluation data is not yet available, previous evaluations (June 2017) have shown great progress for Punjab:  Against a 2019 target of 75 organizations publishing updated institutional information on their websites for information of the public, 81 websites, up from an original baseline of zero, were found in compliance with the requirements of PRMP.  Against a 2019 target of 180 district services being monitored by smart management tools, 216 services, up from a baseline of 18, are now being monitored.  Against a 2019 target of 180 district services for which performance information and citizen feedback is published online, 180 services, up from a baseline of zero, now have performance information and citizen feedback published online.DevTech has modernized government systems around the world in order to create more transparent and efficient financial and fiscal policies. From decentralizing fiscal systems to establishing performance-based budgeting and medium-term expenditure frameworks, our projects have produced sound economic and fiscal policies across the globe. Our rich history in monitoring and evaluation intersects with our public financial management and fiscal sustainability practice through our skilled technical evaluations, allowing us to handle the assessment of World Bank’s PRMP with accuracy and agility.

      "content"	 : "More than 12,000 fathers, mothers, and caregivers have received new knowledge and skills to improve the raising of their children and also their education and security through the Parents’ Schools (EPMs). EPMs are being developed by USAID through the CARS Activity, implemented by DevTech Systems, in Nicaragua’s Caribbean Coast. Mario Gaitán is just one of those 12,000 participants.Mario is a single father who separated from his wife two years ago because she was exercising violence toward their three children. To support his family, he works nights as a security guard. Despite his overnight shift, every morning Mario takes his children to school from his home on the outskirts of the city and picks them up afterward. Mario has secured permission for his children to come 10 minutes late so he can prepare their food and help them get ready in the morning before they begin the lengthy walk to school. He takes advantage of his trip to the school every day to ask about his children’s homework and about their behavior.During a talk at the parent’s school (EPM), Mario shared some of his story and why education for his children is a priority. “I introduce myself as a single father. It hasn’t been easy to care for my children (one girl and two boys), but I’m giving it my best. I barely know how to write, so my hope is that my children study and live free of violence,” Mario said.Mario’s embodies the goal of the Parents’ School (EPM), which is to provide a place for facilitators, parents, and caregivers to share and exchange knowledge and experiences with each other to help strengthen their models and practices of raising and educating their children.",

      "title": "Evaluating for Unintended Consequences – Small Farmer Cooperatives in Guatemala",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Economic development is not an exact science. Far from being predictable, the outcomes of our development assistance may differ from what we plan or expect. We may formulate a solid development hypothesis or theory of change, but there are many variables that enter into the implementation process. We cannot control for all these variables or anticipate the impact they may have. Often, surprises result.  Or as we say in the business, there are often unintended consequences we didn’t expect.A recent example from an evaluation of agricultural micro-enterprise activities in Guatemala illustrates how important it can be to be watchful for unintended consequences.A short time back, USAID provided technical support to help Guatemalan Mayan Indian farmers form small agricultural marketing cooperatives. For some cooperatives the US government funded the import of corn silos, large round metal ‘Butler Bins,’ for Guatemala farmers to store their grains at harvest. The USG also provided technical guidance to the cooperative on how to buy and handle grains that their members wanted to sell.The objective of the program was to help the new cooperatives purchase grains at prices better than the trucker (coyotes) or middlemen were offering member farmers at harvest when prices were depressed because of abundant supplies. The goal was to provide farmers with better, low-cost marketing services than truckers would offer. The marketing cooperative would, it was hoped, take over the truckers’ business of buying, storing and reselling their members’ food grain crops. A successful, financially sustainable cooperative meant a successful program. That was the development hypothesis.When evaluators assessed how well the farmer cooperatives were doing a few years after the corn silos were installed and the project assistance had ended, they were surprised to find that corn silos of a number of the farmer cooperatives were empty at the times they should be full. In some cases, the cooperatives were only nominally functioning with not much trading, if any, going on.Had the evaluators used the original project metric of how much corn the cooperatives traded with their members or how financially viable the cooperatives were from their buying and selling transactions, they would have given the cooperative program a very poor rating.But when the evaluators began to probe deeper and ask the cooperative farmers why the corn silos were empty and why the cooperatives were not buying and selling their members’ grain, the evaluators came away with a different impression of the program.“No. We no longer buy grain from our members,” the cooperative leaders told the evaluators. “But we don’t want you to take away the corn silos from us,” they pleaded.“We did not come to take away your silos,” replied the evaluators. “But we would like to know why they are empty and why you still want them if you don’t use them to trade grain.”“You see,” said the farmers, “the first few years we had the silos we filled them with grain and we were able to buy and sell at good prices for our members. But then the truckers returned and they began to offer our members better prices than they had before we had the silos; prices so good that our cooperative members decided to sell to them and not the cooperative.“With the silos, the truckers know our members can always go back to trading with the cooperative. We need the silos. Empty or full they help us get better prices from the truckers.”The lesson to be learned from this evaluation is that performance criteria laid out at the time a project is designed – in this case, how successful the cooperatives were at using their corn silos for buying and storing grain – may not be the best or even the correct metric to use. A more relevant criterion, in this instance, should be how effective the corn silos were at helping farmers bargain for better prices in the market place. Greater farmer marketing power was an unintended consequence and, in this case, the primary impact of the program and something much more relevant to measure than what originally was intended.The example underscores that those evaluating projects need to be aware of – and on the lookout for – unintended consequences of the activities they examine.",

      "title": "Planning and Implementing Multilingual Education Internationally",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Why is it crucial, but difficult, to know teachers’ language and literacy skills?It is well known that children learn and develop literacy and numeracy skills better when they have instruction in their mother-tongue (or first) language upon entering school. Many countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia have language policies supporting mother-tongue (local language) instruction, and there is a plethora of donor-supported programs in countries around the world helping to implement these policies.Most commonly, the approach to mother-tongue instruction is an early-exit bilingual education model, in which instruction is provided mainly in the students’ first language (L1) while oral language skills are developed in their L2 (which could be the ex-colonial language, an international language, or regional language). L2 literacy skills are then progressively developed and, by grade four, students should be proficient in the L1 and L2.One of the biggest challenges, however, is making sure that the teacher assigned to a particular school speaks, reads, and writes the L1 language of instruction (LOI) as well as having an oral and written command of the L2. Yet very frequently, there is a mismatch between teachers’ language and literacy skills and the school’s designated LOI, which affects the ability of teachers to effectively help students develop their L1 and/or L2 skills.There are multiple reasons that this mismatch may occur:  Teachers may speak the L1 but since they didn’t study it in school or their teacher preparation, they do not have the literacy skills to use it for instruction and teach it to students.  Teacher preparation programs often do not include courses for teachers to develop a local language.  Teacher deployment policies do not consider the teachers’ language abilities to be a requirement.  There is a lack of information (and/or information use) on teachers’ language and literacy skills in regards to the LOI of the schools where they are teaching.To effectively implement mother-tongue instruction, there are some important lessons learned from the field. These include:  Carry out a language-mapping study at the outset in order to have a comprehensive understanding of what teachers’ language and literacy skills are, particularly in the L1.  In Early Grade Reading (EGR) programs, include instruments to assess teachers’ language and literacy skills as part of the student EGR assessment.  Use this information to inform deployment decisions and decisions regarding teacher-grade assignments. Teachers in a school that are competent in the L1 should be assigned to the lower grades.  Work with Ministries of Education and teacher preparation colleges to include courses in the local languages and conduct training in these languages.  Provide highly scripted materials to teachers that lack L1 proficiency to help them develop the students’ L1 language and literacy skills while also improving their own.These are several key recommendations, however, various sources exist that provide specific guidance on how to address this challenge:      Enhancing learning of children from diverse language backgrounds: Mother tongue-based bilingual or multilingual education in early childhood and early primary school years. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002122/212270e.pdf        Africa Language and Literacy.  https://code.ngo/africa-language-and-literacy        Optimising Learning, Education and Publishing in Africa: The Language Factor–A Review and Analysis of Theory and Practice in Mother-Tongue and Bilingual Education in Sub-Saharan Africa. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002126/212602e.pdf  DevTech has a practice area devoted to Education, Gender and Youth.

      "title": "DevTech Project Spotlight: The Safe Schools Program - Malawi",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Children, particularly girls, in Malawi’s primary and secondary schools face high levels of gender-based violence perpetrated by other students and by teachers. This violence comes in the form of both physical and psychological abuse and extends beyond the school environment. Outside the school and within the larger community, girls also fall prey to their peers and older men and are additionally subjected to abusive behavior in the home, negatively affecting their educational attainment and progress, as well as their mental and physical health.In 2003, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) enlisted the help of DevTech’s experts to implement the Safe Schools Program, a pioneering, evidence-based initiative designed to reduce school-related gender-based violence (SRGBV), improve educational outcomes, and reduce negative health outcomes in Malawian schools. We worked to increase advocacy at the national level to prevent SRGBV, improve systematic prevention and response mechanisms at the institutional and community level, and improve self-efficacy at the individual level. Along with implementing programs to accomplish these objectives, we engaged in comprehensive quantitative and qualitative research to fully understand the details of SRGBV in Malawi. We found that:  These findings show that several types of abuse in schools do indeed have a basis in gender norms and perpetuate gender stereotyping, as much of the blame for abuse is placed on the girls.  Interventions must address community-based issues in addition to school-related factors if they are to successfully tackle SRGBV. Dialogue should be opened with initiation counselors and religious leaders and parents and community members should be sensitized and mobilized to work with schools to minimize children’s exposure to risk.  Teachers are often seen as key instruments for change, but this study clearly shows that teachers’ attitudes and behavior are not only significant obstacles to stamping out abusive behavior in schools, but that they can reinforce and perpetuate the problem. More importantly, teachers do not see themselves as enforcers of gender-based stereotypes in school or as perpetrators of SRGBV. All teachers should be given opportunities to reflect on their own gender-related experiences and beliefs.This study illustrates that Malawian communities, pupils, and teachers do not have a full understanding of gender and gender-based violence. However, while this study highlights several issues of concern, it also identifies strengths upon which efforts can be built to ensure that schools in Malawi are safe, that all boys and girls have equal opportunities to learn, gain skills through classroom and extracurricular activities, and are psychologically, sexually, and physically safe from threats, harassment, or harm in all parts of school.DevTech has 30+ years of experience implementing projects that improve job outcomes for youth, expand access to quality education for elementary and secondary school students, contribute to early childhood development and learning, build the capacity of individuals, organizations, and systems, and combat gender-based violence to ensure that all students feel safe. Accordingly, with funding from USAID, DevTech was able to provide comprehensive insight into the school-related gender-based violence affecting Malawian students to begin to work toward a safe, inclusive community for all.

The country has continued on a relatively stable path since, holding several rounds of fair and free parliamentary and presidential elections, finalizing a new constitution, and most recently, forming a new, democratically elected government (source). However, as with all transitions, Tunisia has faced challenges, most notably including the increased threat and mitigation of terrorism, and the consequent overuse of the Tunisian civil security and criminal justice system.Since 2016, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) has supported Tunisian efforts for reformation of security and justice institutions to ensure they protect the rights of the Tunisian people and bolster basic capacities through improved training, equipment, and policies.In 2017, DevTech’s monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) experts performed an evaluation of INL assistance to Tunisia to determine the effectiveness of INL support. Based upon our rigorous assessment of INL assistance, we found that:      The program has been meeting high-level strategic objectives to build the law enforcement sector’s capabilities in various areas.        The program has also achieved the public’s trust through innovative ways of inviting the media and civil society representatives to the training activities.        Finally, the program has been very effective in achieving sustainability, enhanced by allowing master trainers to help design and contextualize training materials and other resources.  From helping developing countries establish autonomy and accountability to broadening rule of law, our goal is to build stronger democratic societies in which citizens are safe, informed, and free. We have designed, implemented, and managed large-scale evaluations in governance, rule of law, criminal justice, and anti-terrorism programs in an effort to improve governance, community resiliency, and local confidence in government institutions. Thus, when we were faced with the challenge of assessing INL’s civil security and criminal justice work in Tunisia, our use of a robust, three step evaluation system, including actual field work in Tunisia, allowed our experts to execute a precise, comprehensive evaluation.

      "content"	 : "In January 2001, severe earthquakes struck parts of El Salvador, causing substantial damage in the affected areas. With almost 7,000 people killed or injured, and more than 400,000 buildings and houses damaged or destroyed, the natural disaster physically and economically devastated parts of the country. By November 2001, major efforts to rebuild the infrastructure and economy of these areas were underway, but were not proving sufficient enough to reactivate the various local economies throughout the country. Thus, in order to stimulate the El Salvadoran economy, USAID and the El Salvadoran government joined forces with DevTech to identify priority needs and actions to reactivate the economic activity of small and micro enterprises in the earthquake damaged regions as quickly as possible.DevTech employed our monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) expertise to assess the problems and constraints and to identify programs, mechanisms, and strategies that could serve to stimulate economic growth and generate more employment.Through robust qualitative and quantitative research, we found that:  The primary constraint impeding growth of small business in El Salvador was simply the lack of economic growth for the country as a whole. Thus, rather than focus economic restructuring efforts on stimulating micro enterprises, there was a greater need for measures aimed at alleviating the significant poverty in El Salvador.  Economic opportunity existed in the rebuilding of infrastructure destroyed by the earthquakes. Public funding for infrastructure development could be channeled through local, small, and micro enterprises which would generate employment, but more importantly improve the quality of life in the areas concerned.  Overall, greater government support for small and micro enterprises would help to reduce high poverty levels by providing business owners with consulting and enterprise development services on a demand-driven basis through the establishment of the Technical Assistance Fund for the Development of Micro and Small Enterprise (TAF).DevTech was founded on the premise that quality research can impact social change and lead to more effective development assistance. We pair strong methodological capabilities in economics, data analytics, finance, and social sciences with the most current technological solutions in developing and designing projects, implementing, and carrying out performance monitoring and evaluation to create sustainable and lasting solutions to the policy challenges. As such, when USAID and the El Salvadoran government partnered with DevTech to identify and evaluate potential solutions to El Salvador’s earthquake and subsequent economic crisis, our M&amp;amp;E experts dug deep to find the root of the problem and provided recommendations for long term, multi-sector development.

      "content"	 : "DevTech Systems is pleased to announce it has won the USAID Data Services contract.  The project, currently known as ADVISE (to be renamed USAID Data Services in 2018), is a follow-on to the Economic Analysis and Data Services (EADS) contract DevTech held from 2007-2018. ADVISE – Analytics, Data, Visualization, and Information Services – merges under one contract four current projects under USAID’s Management Bureau, Chief Information Officer: EADS, USAID’s library (including the Development Experience Clearinghouse – DEC), The Development Data Library (DDL), and the Enterprise Reporting Portal. In addition, ADVISE will work on implementing data governance procedures and standards for the Agency and on unifying database systems and portals.The award of this five-year project is a result of DevTech’s strong performance under EADS and a recognition of its qualifications in data management and analysis.“We are pleased to be able to continue to support the valuable work USAID’s Management Bureau does in supporting publicly available data via visual and interactive tools,” commented Rafael Romeu, President and CEO of DevTech. “We firmly believe that quality data well managed and well visualized enables decision-makers to shape strategic direction and implement projects more efficiently and effectively.”As an example of an early success for this project, ADVISE launched the Women’s Economic Empowerment and Equality (WE3) Dashboard in April. This is a joint effort with USAID’s Office of Gender Equality &amp;amp; Women’s Empowerment (USAID/E3/GenDev) and a long-term project of ex-EADS staff now made available under ADVISE. It is a visual and interactive tool that is used to explore data related to women’s economic, social, and political inclusion. It allows users to assess the extent to which women participate in their respective economies, and compare the selected economy to regional, income group, and global averages. The WE3 Dashboard is publicly available at https://idea.usaid.gov/women-e3.",

      "content"	 : "The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) works to keep Americans safe at home by countering international crime, illegal drugs, and instability abroad. INL helps countries deliver justice and fairness by strengthening their police, courts, and corrections systems. These efforts reduce the amount of crime and illegal drugs reaching U.S. shores. As part of INL, the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative Program (CBSI) has been working to reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and security, and promote social justice in 13 Caribbean countries since 2010.In 2014, DevTech conducted an evaluation of CBSI, collecting data from seven of the 13 Caribbean countries. The following year, the Department of State called on our Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) experts again to assess CBSI. DevTech collected data from the remaining six countries and conducted a cross-national survey in order to provide INL decision makers with information on the extent to which INL projects and activities have been implemented as intended, what problems or issues have arisen, and how programs might be modified to ensure successful implementation.Upon evaluation, we found that INL’s assistance has had a positive impact on both individual and institutional outcomes, and on regional integration and coordination (Source):      At the individual level, more than 90% of survey respondents who received training said the training allowed them to be more efficient and effective in their work, while just under 90% of respondents who received CBSI-funded equipment noted the same effect.        85% of training participants said that training facilitated the creation of informal networks of professionals, and that these networks enabled respondents to better perform their duties.        For example, participants in the INL-funded Gang Investigations and Prosecutions program applied knowledge and techniques taught in the program to arrest and charge one of Port of Spain’s biggest gang leaders.  Based on our evaluation, we leveraged our extensive M&amp;amp;E expertise in order to provide INL with best practices for future programming, including:      Promoting hands-on training that teaches practical skills, such as forensic investigation techniques or necessary language skills, over purely theoretical or awareness-raising training.        Bringing U.S. expert trainers to the region as much as possible, especially when they are able to teach to the specific country context, rather than sending trainees to U.S-based training.  When DevTech was founded in 1984, our earliest projects supported development efforts in the Caribbean. Employing our rich M&amp;amp;E capabilities, we still monitor the performance and evaluate the impact of development assistance projects in the Caribbean and have evolved to implement innovative and practical solutions in over 100 countries around the world. Accordingly, when the U.S. Department of State enlisted the help of DevTech’s experts to assess the impact of CBSI, our deep familiarity with the Caribbean region, combined with our 32+ years of M&amp;amp;E experience, allowed us to tackle the project with precision.

      "title": "DevTech Project Spotlight: Internal Evaluation of USAID’s Program on Rights and Justice in Cambodia",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Beginning in the early 90s, with the help of the United Nations, Cambodia began to transition from a suffering country plagued by genocide, civil war, and frequent military and political upheaval to a democratic form of government. In a continuing effort to develop democratic foundations in Cambodia, in 2003, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) implemented the first Program on Rights and Justice (PRAJ I), an activity aimed at building judicial reform and strengthening Cambodia’s society after it’s scarring history. Then, in 2008, USAID followed with PRAJ II, which continued to promote judicial reform through development of judicial databases, expanded access to legal aid and legal education, and growth of Cambodia’s Ministry of Justice, with an overarching goal of improving the civil society of Cambodia.As the program drew to a close in 2014, USAID enlisted the help of DevTech’s Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) experts to assess PRAJ II in order to inform the design and strategy of its next generation of Democracy and Governance (DG) programming.Upon evaluation, we found that:      The initial assumption that the central government would fully engage in the reform had not sufficiently been met, largely due to a highly politicized and at times, uncooperative Bar Association of the Kingdom of Cambodia (BAKC), Ministry of the Interior (MOI) and MOJ, and declining resources.        The Monitoring &amp;amp; Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) system used did not properly align with the needs of PRAJ II, as the indicators used to measure the progress project were not adequate measures of the intended results of the project. For example, given the length of time often needed for legal aid cases to flow through the court system, the small size of legal aid firms and NGOs, and the few organizations providing legal aid, these numbers could change very little from one year to the next, let alone from one quarter to the next.  Based on the results of this evaluation, we used our deep-level experience with security, transparency, and governance to provide recommendations for further DG programming:      USAID is one player among many attempting to achieve democratic reform in Cambodia. Therefore, future projects would be well-served by forming an association/ coalition of actors seeking to create a more democratic society and the pooling of donor funds to support democratic reform.        With a common planning and M&amp;amp;E approach, success might be more easily achieved by creating a few common indicators in one progress report per quarter for those receiving small grants in order to capture incremental change.  Devtech improves the security, transparency, and the capacity of urban and local governments in countries around the world, implementing projects that counter violent extremism, improve fiscal transparency, improve rule of law and criminal justice systems, strengthen civil society, and more. We bring significant expertise in developing and implementing intergovernmental relationships by providing local governments with the authority and the capacity to fulfill their new responsibilities and amplify the voices of their citizens. As such, when USAID called on DevTech to evaluate the performance of PRAJ II, our strong M&amp;amp;E capabilities and background in governmental development allowed us to provide technologically robust and innovative solutions.To learn more about this project and DevTech’s capabilities, please visit the full report.",

      "title": "Four Challenges of Debt Restructuring",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Debt restructuring is a process by which an entity in financial distress renegotiates its debts. One of the most visible debt restructuring efforts underway today is for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  American cities like Detroit, Michigan, and Stockton, California, and sovereign nations like Greece and Argentina have also faced this process.  Entities facing restructuring face numerous challenges, including:      Restructuring frameworks: US municipalities can pursue bankruptcy and restructuring under US federal law, but when the entity requiring restructuring is not subject to federal law there may be no established legal framework or pathway.  Puerto Rico required US Congress to pass legislation establishing a restructuring framework (PROMESA) for the territory.  In the case of sovereign nations, there is a wide diversity of circumstances and approaches.  Supranational lenders like the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club frequently become involved.        Economic forecasts: Throughout the restructuring process, understanding the economic effects of proposed policies and how they will affect future cash flows and debt sustainability is crucial.  This requires sophisticated economic analysis of existing economic conditions and drivers of economic growth as well as the interactions between these growth factors and policy.        Restoring viability: Following a debt crisis, it is vital that the indebted entity address the underlying conditions that contributed to the debt crisis and develop a feasible, credible plan for restoring economic viability in the future.  A sustainable path forward requires pursuing the right economic policies and will involve shared sacrifices by all stakeholders.  A restructuring proposal must include reasonable prospects for restoring financial viability.  Determining a course of action requires a comprehensive understanding of specific economic conditions and thorough analysis of policy alternatives.        Transparency: Transparency is a guiding principle in debt restructuring.  Transparency enhances accountability and facilitates due diligence by creditors.  This entails disclosing information about the debtor’s economic and financial condition that entities may not typically share, as well as details about the forward-looking economic strategy as justification for the debt restructuring.  Managing a financial crisis demands compelling data-driven decision support solutions for all stakeholders. DevTech combines its strong technical capabilities in economics, macro-fiscal modeling, data analytics, financial management, and social sciences with its data visualization, project design, and performance monitoring and evaluation expertise to identify sustainable solutions to public financial challenges.",

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Countries in the East Asia Pacific (EAP) region face extremely high climate-related disaster risks from typhoons, hurricanes, monsoon rains, volcanoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and other natural phenomena. Indonesia in particular endures over 2,000 disaster events each year, with the incidence of natural disasters rising by almost 350 percent over the last three decades.To mitigate these risks, the United States Agency for International Development/Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) has funded a range of disaster risk reduction activities in the region, including the Incident Command System (ICS) activity, a standardized incident management approach applicable to any disaster scenario and designed to improve coordination and communication among the various actors and agencies involved in disaster response. Among other components, the program includes standardized training and consistent certification requirements for disaster response staff.In 2017, after eight years of supporting ICS in Indonesia, USAID sought a deeper understanding of the successes and areas for improvement of the program to inform future decisions. USAID enlisted the help of DevTech’s experts to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Incident Command System in order to better understand the effectiveness and sustainability of the program.Upon evaluation, we found that:      Prior to the implementation of the ICS model, stakeholders (such as the national and local governments of Indonesia, and training staff) felt disaster response was disorganized and communication systems among agencies were poor whereas after implementation, stakeholders reported improvements in disaster response times and ICS use among partner GoI (Government of Indonesia) agencies.        There was a need for ICS and its resources to be more contextualized to the Indonesian setting, feedback shared by 67 percent of respondents. Respondents said that ICS needed to understand the dynamics of the local culture and ICS resources such as forms, manuals, and other documents not only need to be translated to Bahasa, but also needed to be revised to use terminologies that would be easier for stakeholders to accept.        Due to the recent decentralization of the Indonesian government, reported low information retention from master trainers, and a need for stronger Indonesian contextualization (see above), the program still had room to grow, an effort that could be informed and aided by the evaluation that DevTech performed.  We know that development work does not always mean building something new; it can mean protecting what is already there.  Therefore, we pair our strong methodological capabilities in research with insightful and practical solutions to support the protection of communities and countries around the world. Thus, when USAID needed assistance to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of the ICS program in Indonesia, we were able to employ our deep experience in environmental development to create a sustainable and lasting solution for better disaster prevention.

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Across Nicaragua, there are several communities that experience higher crime rates and lower education rates than the rest of the country. USAID’s Community Action for Reading and Security (CARS) program is an ongoing project that supports these communities by providing struggling primary school students with the resources they need to improve in school. Additionally, CARS promotes positive change in communities through contracting local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to implement community development projects.Since 2013, DevTech has worked with USAID to design, develop, and manage the CARS project to improve the quality of education and improve citizen security in these at-risk Nicaraguan communities. In 2014, we conducted two baseline studies in these communities—one to determine language fluency and comprehension of primary school students, and one to determine community needs and risk factors such as improving education, reducing crime and drug use, and bettering general health, water quality, and sanitation. To measure the progress of the CARS project, we conducted  a follow up study in 2015 and found that:      English comprehension of primary school students increased by 8% while Spanish comprehension increased by 48%. In addition, primary school enrollment increased from 88% in 2013 to 93% in 2015 and general educational advancement of students increased at a rate of 94%.        At the beginning of 2015, a total of 316 primary and secondary students recieved tutoring services because they were failing in one or more subjects. By the the second half of 2015, 74% of these students had improved their grades by an average of 7 points above the initial grade.        In one of the five communities in which CARS is focusing their efforts (Bluefields), there was an increase in Spanish fluency from 5.28%, 40.32% and 47.86% in 2014 to 50%, 57% and 67% in 2015 among first, second, and third graders respectively.  DevTech produced such strong results for the CARS project through the development of education materials for teachers in English, Miskitu, and Spanish, including teacher guides, student lesson books, and supplementary reading materials.Around the world, DevTech promotes safe, inclusive, and effective learning environments by working with government leaders and international partners to broaden education and training opportunities for children, at-risk youth, and adults. We have designed and supported major education projects in areas such as Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Thus, when implementing the CARS project in Nicaragua, we employed our deep experience with large-scale educational and community development projects to ensure that the project rests upon a strong, research-based foundation and will continue to allow these at-risk areas to develop a safer and better educated community.

      "title": "Best Practices for Helping Small Businesses Work Effectively Overseas",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Working as a contractor for the U.S. government (USG) overseas is always challenging, particularly when that work is carried out in non-permissive or hostile operating environments.  These challenges are amplified when the contractor is a small business, as smaller firms often lack the human and institutional resources needed to cope with the unique demands such environments impose.DevTech Systems, Inc. has had substantial successful experience working overseas for the USG, often in difficult circumstances.  We are, for example, currently implementing USAID Mission-wide contracts in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Nigeria; have recently participated in the Department of State’s Evaluation IQC in Afghanistan, Iraq, and East Africa; and are advising the Government of Puerto Rico, where DevTech is the economic forecasting and analysis provider for debt restructuring.   We have also worked on Public Financial Management issues with the World Bank, IMF, and IDB in such countries as Jordan, Pakistan, and Tanzania.  Even in highly non-permissive environments, we have been able to provide our clients with a full suite of monitoring and evaluation, data collection, and data visualization services, consistently offering our clients DevTech’s world-class technical expertise.In this work, we have found that the U.S. government approach to working with contractors overseas can vary widely from country to country and from agency to agency.  In our experience, however, there are several best practices that certain U.S. Embassies and missions have adopted that make it much easier for all businesses, particularly small ones, to work effectively overseas; these best practices thereby help the U.S. achieve its foreign policy objectives.Flexibility is KeyThe first thing to remember is that Flexibility is Key.  We work in dynamic environments; circumstances change, as does our understanding of those circumstances.  The instruments through which we work therefore must be equally dynamic.  When operating environments change dramatically, the U.S. Government and the contractor community need to be as flexible as possible in adjusting scopes of work, workplans  – and, most importantly, adjusting expectations – to reflect those changes.The current situation in Nicaragua offers a useful example of this sort of welcome flexibility; in the face of mounting civil unrest throughout the country, the USAID Mission there has prioritized the safety of its partner staff and has allowed its contractors and grantees to adjust their workplans and limit themselves to low-profile, indoor activities for the duration of the current emergency.  Longer-term, the mission is adjusting its portfolio to attach greater emphasis to programs that support the expression of democratic values and the freedom of speech – another example of how the USG can adjust its assistance programs quickly to respond to changing needs.Proper Prior Planning Prevents Poor PerformanceSecond, to borrow a favorite phrase from the military, Embassies and missions do best when they keep in mind that “Proper Prior Planning Prevents Poor Performance”.  For example, when USG offices overseas are expecting the arrival of a short-term technical assistance team, be it to conduct an evaluation, design a project, or provide technical assistance to the post itself or to the host country, it is very useful for those offices to have on hand, in advance of the team’s arrival, a checklist of foreseeable items and at least the basic documents (e.g., annual reports, quarterly reports, planning materials, PMPs, PADs, budgets, etc.) that the team will need to hit the ground running.  Such preparation helps avoid wasted time, and thereby both saves the U.S. taxpayer money and makes it more likely that the USG will get the results it is expecting (and for which it is paying) from those contractors.Change Isn’t Always GoodThird, it is useful for the government to recall that “Change isn’t Always Good”.  All contractors, of course, be they small or large, would always prefer to work with a stable USG staff on the other side of the table.  Having one Contracting Officer and one Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) over the life of any award is always the ideal situation.  Today, however, particularly in non-permissive environments such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and South Sudan, that simply isn’t a realistic expectation.  In those posts, the norm is for USG officers to serve one-year assignments – which in turn means that over the life of a five-year award, a contractor might work with four or five different Contracting Officers and CORs.  In these situations, missions that emphasize careful handover planning (and, where possible, overlap) tend to minimize disruptions caused by staff turnover.  DevTech has found it useful, for example, when posts require a mandatory turn over meeting – even if it’s virtual or pre-recorded – to walk staff inheriting old portfolios through the underlying rationale for and requirements of those portfolios.  This helps prevent “orphaned” contracts and allows new CORS to get up to speed quickly about why contractors are doing what they are doing.Focus on Ends, not MeansFinally, DevTech has found that our USG partners are most successful when they Focus on Ends, not Means.  For example, RFPs that focus on desired results rather than on prescribing the exact technical interventions needed to achieve those results are more likely to benefit most from the accumulated expertise of the industry – which is, after all, what the USG is paying for.  Similarly, missions that broadly define the technical expertise required give themselves a broader pool of talent from which to select.  In our experience, Government does best when it allows more staffing flexibility to contractors.  If, toward the end of the procurement process, the Government decides that the staffing proposed is inadequate or inappropriate, it can correct this at the BAFO stage.  This is a mechanism which we believe the USG should use more often.There are of course many other things that the USG does to help small businesses working with it overseas.  The above examples represent only a sample of our experience.  But DevTech believes these and other best practices deserve careful study and wide replication.  The contracting community, through organizations such as the Professional Services Council, should advocate for this outcome.",

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provides economic development and humanitarian assistance to foreign countries around the world. For more than 30 years, DevTech has worked closely with USAID to monitor the performance and evaluate the impact of USAID and USAID programs through robust data collection and quality research.In 2004, USAID implemented a promotional strategy to spread awareness of USAID and USAID programs in Senegal and has since conducted regular national surveys to assess the visibility of these programs among the Senegalese people. In 2008, USAID administered a comprehensive national opinion poll on the visibility of USAID in terms of geographical coverage and population groups. Then, in order to assess visibility of USAID over time, the organization enlisted the help of DevTech’s experts to conduct a follow-up study in 2010. The goal of the study was to evaluate the overall perception of USAID in Senegal across sex, age, income, education level, occupation, ethnicity and region.Upon evaluation, we found that:  Further promotional efforts should be directed toward women and those with lower levels of education, as they are least likely to be aware of USAID and its programs. 90.3% of respondents stated that they were aware of foreign assistance to Senegal but 46% of respondents did not know about USAID specifically.  Higher awareness of USAID will contribute to a better image of the United States among the Senegalese people. About 90% of respondents had a favorable opinion of USAID and said that foreign aid cultivated a more favorable opinion of the United States.  In a change from the 2008 study that showed that more rural dwelling people were aware of USAID, the 2010 study showed near equal awareness between rural (90.5%) and urban (90%) dwellers.With the help of our experts, USAID was able to assess the visibility of its programs over time, identify target populations on whom to focus their future promotional efforts, and more effectively implement development assistance in Senegal. In our 32+ years of M&amp;amp;E experience, DevTech has successfully managed and implemented more than 250 monitoring and evaluation activities in more than 100 countries across complicated socioeconomic contexts and non-permissive environments. Accordingly, when faced with the challenge of evaluating the visibility of USAID’s large scale international development efforts, DevTech handled it with precision and agility.

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Nicaragua CARS ProjectIn the coastal communities of Nicaragua, young children are joining the fight to end human trafficking through an unlikely way: a puppet show. (Click here to view the video.)The puppet theater performance is called “Chef Gustof, a Nice Deceiver,” and it seeks to illuminate the often taboo yet very present risk of child trafficking on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua. The performance was designed and produced by a group of young student beneficiaries from the Community Action for Reading and Security (CARS) Activity funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) implemented by DevTech Systems, Inc.The puppet theater performance raises awareness and dispels myths about the prevalence and tactics used by traffickers by expressing first-hand accounts of child trafficking in the coastal communities. These first-hand experiences not only draw attention to the issue, but also and arguably more importantly, empower kids in these neighborhoods to take action.Prior to developing the training, the six primary school students received training on human trafficking, personal prevention strategies, and risks for children in order to deepen their understanding of the issue. Then they spent more than 20 hours developing the ideas, dialogues, scenography and production of the play, including audio recording, editing and choreography for a closing dance.The story recreates a scene in a local park, where young children meet a stranger named Chef Gustof, who manages to entice the children with false promises until they are eventually kidnapped by him. The child’s family and the authorities react in time and manage to capture the network of traffickers, leading to a happy ending to the story.“The stories of child trafficking do not always have a happy ending like this, in most cases the children who are victims of trafficking are not recovered and end up with very sad stories,” says Keysha, an eight-year-old member of the group who created the puppet play.“We decided to create a story with puppets because that is what kids enjoy, but we are also interested in presenting how traffickers show love and build trust until they create victims,” explains Heyman, 9 years old and a member of the group of actors.The puppets sing, dance, speak in rhyme, laugh, and cry to capture children’s attention, strengthen listening skills, and vocabulary development. They also warn children, parents, and community members about the dangers of trafficking and empower the audience to take action. The puppet show has been showcased at the American Chamber of Commerce in Nicaragua national business school fair, national and local TV channels, local fairs, and local radio and in a national newspaper.The DevTech initiative emphasizes arts and culture through drama to connect with audiences on a far more emotional level than most other education efforts, potentially leading to greater learning and eventual behavioral change. In schools, this puppet theater performance will continue to engage children, parents and community members in Nicaragua in making the path to peacebuilding a personal one.",

      "title": "Education in a Multi-Ethnic and Multi-Cultural Context: Understanding the past to comprehend the present",
      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "In order to understand the high illiteracy rate and educational context on the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, it is necessary to take a look back at Nicaragua’s history.The “Mosquito Shore,” now known as the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua, was militarily annexed to the Republic of Nicaragua in 1894 by President Jose Santos Zelaya. A few years after this military annexation, a presidential decree declared that all education in Nicaragua, which included the recently annexed Mosquito Shore, would be taught in Spanish. Many people on the Mosquito Shore, who did not speak Spanish, questioned why they were forced to learn in Spanish.Classes on the mosquito shore were previously given only in French and English and teachers were brought from Europe, USA, Jamaica and other countries. After the presidential decree, the Mosquito Shore’s Moravian Junior High School was renamed Colegio Moravo Secundaria. The high school had a reputation compared to universities from any part of Nicaragua and it had a very high rate of employability. But all of that would change.In 1909, the Moravian Junior high school closed for over 10 years, because it needed to transform its curriculum from French and English to Spanish. Administrators had to find Spanish teachers to teach classes in Spanish, but the students couldn’t speak or understand a word in Spanish. On the Caribbean coast, the students spoke primarily English, Miskito, Kriol, Garifuna, and Rama. Many parents reacted by keeping their children at home instead of sending them to class, causing several generations of people on the Caribbean coast to have no education at all. These generations could not even read or write.Nevertheless, over time kids started to attend the Colegio Moravo Secundaria and throughout the years, other schools opened with Spanish curriculum. Still, much of the history, language, culture, and identity of the Caribbean coast were not taught in the Spanish speaking schools. Over the years, it became apparent that the culture still had not assimilated to the curriculum.How complicated it is for teachers and students to teach and learn in a multicultural and multilingual context?The Indigenous and Afro-descendant people whose maternal language is not Spanish usually face more difficult experiences learning in school. They often face difficulty learning to read, both in Spanish and their mother tongue, mainly because grammar and classes in native languages are rarely taught in school, but they never speak Spanish at home. All early grade school language and math lessons are taught in Spanish, a language they barely know.When kids are at home, parents, mothers, and family members typically speak to their children in either Miskito or Kriol. These languages have prevailed since many people can’t fluently read or write Spanish in rural areas.This creates a problem. A Kriol speaking teacher with minimal Spanish will teach classes to a Kriol speaking child who also has minimal knowledge of Spanish. While the textbooks are in Spanish, teachers often resort to speaking Kriol or another native language. In another city, a Miskito teacher who speaks only enough Spanish to communicate, but does not know Spanish grammar, will use Spanish text to teach Miskito speaking children. Good intentions to bring Miskito or Kriol textbooks to rural areas are futile since children are not taught to read or write in their native tongue. The result is students who speak very little Spanish and read and write very little in their native language. Without a solid knowledge of either Spanish or their native tongue, students will continue to have a very low literacy rate on the Caribbean coast.This presents serious issues in the educational environment along the Caribbean coast. In order to increase the literacy rate and better prepare students, it is important to understand the past.",

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "In recent years, the concept of Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management has become very popular in organizations, especially within the international development field. However, this trend extends beyond learning about project outcomes and it encompasses more than the process of one person reporting and analyzing the results of a project.In order for Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management to be an effective activity, it is crucial that everyone who participated to some extent in the project’s execution is subsequently involved in communicating the outcomes, success stories, achievements, and improvement opportunities to the different audiences. It should not be limited to one on one interactions or any other limited structure like the Shannon-Weaver Model of Communication, developed in 1949, which simplified the channel of communication into a one-way process from sender to receiver.Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management objectives can be achieved if the learning process is executed as a group activity where different points of view are shared between those who worked on a project and the audience so that different ideas and opinions are fully exchanged. The end result of this dialogue should be the development of better practices for the future, whether in international development or any other field.For many, Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management is limited to gathering information and presenting it in reports, which many people do not read, and worst of all, it is not taken into consideration for future proposals and projects. It is important that this concept becomes more than just a title and that it transforms into a useful and beneficial practice for the benefit of all.An inclusive communications strategy should be developed for this concept to work to its fullest potential. The idea is to make key actors in a specific industry or topic more involved and informed on the outcomes of a project. As a result of this practice, both sides participate and become agents of change when working on future projects.There is no formula for this process, but there are good practices that can be mimicked to lead Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management teams. The goal is that everyone can comfortably manage information and trace a route to communicate in an effective way. The mission of this effort is to engage more with the public interested in the topic. A key concept in Learning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management is accountability. This term is very important when working on collaborative projects.Accountability is defined as the process of sharing the knowledge acquired from a specific project in a transparent manner. Part of this transparency includes sharing with the public information about the entities that donated funds to make the project possible and how those funds were invested. By adding accountability to the Leaning &amp;amp; Knowledge Management process, you complete the cycle of information management.",

      "type": "Insight Posting",
      "content"	 : "Nutrition during the first years of life is an essential component for human development. Malnutrition can be caused by a lack or excess of food. Malnutrition due to lack of food can be classified in 3 types:  Acute: Underweight and stunted growth  Chronic: Stunted growth  Global: UnderweightThe excess of nutrition during the first years of life is very likely to cause obesity. In Guatemala in particular, among children under the age of five, 46.5% of are stunted, 4.7% are overweight, and 1% are wasted (UNICEF, Monitoring the Situation of Children and Women, 2015).Acute malnutrition must be treated immediately and children diagnosed with this type of malnutrition should receive special treatment since there is a high risk of death.Chronic malnutrition is relatively silent; children with this disease generally don’t receive a diagnosis. Guatemala is the country with the highest risk of chronic malnutrition in Latin America and the 5th in the world. This makes chronic malnutrition the biggest nutrition issue among Guatemalan children.According to the Maternal-Infant nutrition glossary:Chronic Malnutrition is also called “stunting.” It is the result of a bad nutrition for long periods of time or episodes of infection.  It’s a deficiency developed in the long run, which manifests as not growing up properly (short height) and can cause irreversible damages to the brain.Anthropometric data on children under 5 years were captured during the Monitoring and Evaluation Survey of the Occidental High Plateau, with the objective of calculating the main indicators of infant nutrition.The following graph presents the behavior of chronic malnutrition in the first 59 months (5 years) of life. You can see in the graph that the risk of chronic malnutrition doubles between 6 to 24 months.It is evident that children between the ages of 6 to 24 months are more vulnerable. One cause could be that they consume less breastmilk. From 24 months onward, the risk of chronic malnutrition remains very constant.Because of these high risks, Guatemala has programs to prevent chronic malnutrition, especially within the first 1,000 days of a child’s life, which includes the period between conception to the time the child is 24 months old.",

        "content"  : "DevTech Systems President and CEO, Rafael Romeu, was quoted this July in The Miami Herald regarding Cuba’s need for currency reform and the likelihood of a reform occurring. The article entitled, “Cuba badly needs currency reform, but it won’t happen yet, economists say” was written by Mimi Whitefield and was written following the Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy’s (ASCE) annual conference. Romeu is a member of ASCE and spoke on a panel regarding monetary duality and currency unification at the conference.Whitefield’s article explores the need for unification of Cuba’s two currencies and economists, like Romeu, share their insight regarding timing and currency conditions. In the article, Romeu discusses how Cuba’s currency form is intertwined with the economic state of Venezuela, who is the typical source of foreign transfers. Romeu goes on to share why he doesn’t see unification happening in the current environment.The full article can be found here.",

These were:Civil Society Programs require a long-term strategy USAID/DR’s foresight to support the initiative over a 10-year period was critical. It provided the necessary time to build the projects carefully, let them take hold, and eventually reach out to a broad and receptive public. Changing political culture needs at least a decade ****One step behind approach is critical An essential part of the strategy to promote democracy in the DR was to maintain a low profile, allowing the Dominican grantees to take the visible lead in pushing for democratic reforms. This one step behind strategy conferred legitimacy and credibility to the effort as a Dominican initiative and was key to its success.Flexibility Given the fluidity of the political situation in the DR, it was essential for the USAID Mission to support a &quot;demand&quot; rather than a &quot;supply&quot; driven initiative.

The BPS Project’s goal was to help the GFRN solidify institutional roles in the budget preparation process and establish a multi-year budgeting capability. The project provided technical assistance and training in the areas of planning processes, budget preparation and formulation, budget execution, and organizational development. DevTech provided technical assistance in organizational development to the Budget Office of the Federation (BOF) in the Ministry of Finance and to the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence (BMPI) Unit of the Office of the President.The BOF was divided into several departments that had historically functioned as separate entities, with little understanding or incentive for aligning each department under a unifying overall objective, resulting in inefficiency, mismanagement, and unclear roles. Thus, DevTech conducted a participatory analysis of the departments, and then helped them to clearly define their respective roles in the budget process regarding the overall BOF strategic plan. Following this exercise, DevTech helped BOF staff develop departmental objectives that were in alignment with the overall BOF objectives, with measurable performance indicators built into each objective. DevTech staff also provided input into the development of a training program.The BMPI unit was responsible for ensuring that the Office of the President was fully informed about the budgetary process at three levels:  Budget Formulation—providing a pool of experts and a Price Intelligence Database (PID) tool to ensure accuracy and authenticity of expenditure proposals submitted by various governmental units;  Budget Prioritization—establishing the strategic and planning priorities for future allocation of resources; and  Budget Execution—enhancing the efficiency and the effectiveness of programs and service delivery as well as the overall management of resources.The BMPI Unit’s staff members were mostly contract hires and the BMPI Unit Director planned to have these positions and these staff &quot;regularized&quot; into the civil service, as full-time staff.To help the BMPI Unit achieve its goals, DevTech assessed consultants’ contracts and assisted with planning for the transition of consultancies to full-time staff. DevTech staff reviewed the consultants’ perceptions regarding their work with the BMPI vis-à-vis their career development targets; identified factors that inhibit and stimulate the staff in their current roles, and incentives that would make employment more attractive; and provided a methodology to regularize the consulting staff of the BMPI within the civil service structure, upon full-time enrollment. DevTech also conducted an evaluation of existing skills of personnel and identified additional skills required of sector specialists and training needs; helped BMPI staff define personnel job descriptions and create a nomenclature of compensation; identified ways to attract additional expertise into the BMPI Unit; identified a transition strategy for departing staff (sector specialists) and new hires; defined recruitment procedures for new hires; and reviewed and developed organizational performance, standards of performance, appraisal, and teamwork.",

The purpose of CARS is to improve early grade reading outcomes and contribute to reducing citizen insecurity in five municipalities in the Northern Autonomous Caribbean Coast Region (RACCN) and Southern Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCS) in Nicaragua, where both education and crime statistics lag behind the national averages. DevTech is working in close partnership with local organizations to implement an evidence-based approach to conduct activities at the municipal, community, and school level to transition to a local-led model to educational development and citizen security.DevTech has designed, developed, and managed the CARS activity to improve the quality of education for at-risk children and improve citizen security, working in partnership with local organizations that deliver services within a framework of effective monitoring, evaluation, and evidence-based decision making. Additionally, CARS results support the achievement of goals one and three of USAID’s education strategy by implementing a series of interventions under four mutually reinforcing components:  formal and non-formal reading programs;  community engagement;  local capacity development; and  knowledge generation and management.Under CARS, DevTech has developed RACCS/RACCN specific education materials for teachers in English, Miskitu, and Spanish including teacher guides, student lesson books, and supplementary reading materials to improve the material that teachers have in the participating schools. Additionally, we worked closely to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate reading materials (50 titles per grade) in Spanish, Miskitu, and Creole. All materials are aligned with the SEAR and the national curriculum, and include stories written by youth about resilience to drugs and violence, stories written by children about pride in their culture and dreams for the future of their community.The CARS activity also offers a weekend diploma program which provides teachers the opportunity to earn a diploma in improved active teaching-learning methodologies. Our approach integrates experiential learning by enabling educators to practice the new techniques with the children each week.",

        "content"  : "DevTech has been the prime contractor for the Economic Analysis and Data Services (EADS), an information system providing macro-level international economic and social statistical data to the USG for over 20 years. The Economic Analysis and Data Services is USAID’s central source for U.S. foreign assistance data, international socioeconomic data, and data-driven analysis in support of USAID goals. EADS manages six databases and five public websites (https://eads.usaid.gov), containing data from across the Agency, U.S. Government, and international development organizations. EADS generates the data in three of the databases through data calls to USG agencies, different parts of USAID and USAID partners. The fourth database collects international socioeconomic data from reputable sources and makes them available to USAID, its partners and the public, through unique data visualizations and tools on one convenient site. The six databases are the following:  Foreign Aid Database - This database is the basis for the US government annual reporting of foreign assistance data to Congress (the Greenbook), as well as US government’s annual reporting to the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (USAAR: U.S. Government’s Annual Assistance Report). It contains all US government foreign assistance data from 1946 to the present. This data is available publicly via the Foreign Aid Explorer (FAE) website.  Economic and Social Database - collects country level economic and social data from around the world, from sources such as the World Bank, IMF, UN agencies, and US government sources as well (e.g. USAID’s Demographic and Health Surveys). It brings these sources into one location on the International Data and Economic Analysis (IDEA) website,  and makes them easily acessable to USAID staff, facilitating identification of appropriate and updated data.  Trade Capacity Building Database - reports all trade capacity building activities from the U.S. government.  Microenterprise Results Reporting Database - source of data for USAID’s reporting of its microenterprise supporting activities in compliance with the Microenterprise Results and Accountability Act (MRAA) of 2004.  Foreign Assistance Data Redaction System (FADRS) – has helped to institutionalize redactions by housing all redaction requests in a central web interface. It has also streamlined the process of reporting and protected the privacy of staff by making it easier to remove personally identifiable information.  Tying Status Aid Database (TSAD) - reporting tied/untied procurement/grant actions to the OECD, Department of the Treasury, and the Export-Import Bank of the U.S.Based on the databases maintained by EADS, the EADS team of economists and data scientists responds to requests for data, analysis, and visualizations from USAID and its partners and supports USAID operations at headquarters and in the field. These requests have resulted in the creation of a number of products including country profiles updated 2-3 times per year, analytical briefs, snapshots (summaries) of recent data releases, and special studies. By providing USAID staff with a central data source, backed by a team of experienced economists and data analysts, EADS improves the efficiency of USAID’s operations and the quality of its handling and reporting of international development data.EADS launched a new Country Dashboard feature to the IDEA website, which is an interactive data visualization tool that allows USAID staff to compare a country with selected groups of countries and assess its progress over time. The Dashboard compares countries across eight sectors, 45 subsectors, and 335 indicators and provides the most up-to-date data. It shows selected indicators for countries that USAID assists, benchmarked against regional data or data for countries of similar income. Users can compare country values with income groups and regional averages, or view the trend line and ranking of a specific indicator. The country dashboard brings several benefits to our IDEA website: it allows users to benchmark data against regional averages and the average of countries of similar income; it adds visual appeal; and it provides users with a selected subset.EADS is also responsible for providing the Finding and Using Development Data (FUDD) training to USAID staff, which is offered three times per year in Arlington, VA. EADS recently produced an online version of the class, which is now available to all USAID staff and used primarily in the field at USAID’s missions. USAID staff from all sectors and bureaus use FUDD to better understand, analyze, and visualize the wealth of development date available in their specific line of work.",

In its discussion of the educational crisis, the paper addressed financial constraints, the dilemma of quality versus coverage, and dependence on external financial resources.

DevTech conducted the necessary technical analysis to adjust the program activities and re-target assistance. DevTech also helped the Governor of the San Marcos Department establish a system for municipalities to implement reconstruction activities and monitor reconstruction projects in the aftermath of Hurricane Stan.DevTech incorporated an integrated performance monitoring system for its work at the local government level, which includes indicators for more than 20 lower-level results, and data collection (baseline and yearly) in 15 municipalities. The system served as a basis for establishing indicators of municipal development and guided program activities.The Program had four Sub-Intermediate Results (IR):  Sub-IR 2.1 More transparent systems for management of public resources by local governments  Sub-IR 2.2 Increased devolution of responsibilities and resources to the local level resulting in greater responsiveness by local governments to citizens’ needs  Sub-IR 2.3 More opportunities for citizen participation in and oversight of local government decision-making  Sub-IR 2.4 Local capacity for the development and implementation of reconstruction program strengthened in the San Marcos Department.The Sub-IR 2.1.indicator measured the improvement in the fiscal performance of the selected municipalities. For the 13 selected Program municipalities, intergovernmental transfers were, on average, 92 percent of total revenues in 2008. The annual rate of growth of own-source revenues for the 13 selected municipalities increased from -0.5 percent in 2005 to 41.2 percent in 2008.Technical assistance was delivered through three mechanisms:  Updating the municipal fees schedules;  Improving operating regulations and collection of fees for municipal services; and  Strengthening policies to reduce the avoidance of the payment of municipal services.In addition to the improvement in revenue collection, the Program successfully strengthened the public financial management systems at the municipal level. These included a public procurement system, financial management system, auditing units, and internal controls. In the base year of 2005, the average score for the 13 municipalities was 31 out of 100 points. When the Program closed in September 2009, the average had increased to 89 out of 100 points.Sub-IR 2.2. increased devolution of responsibilities and greater responsiveness to citizen needs. The focus of the activities in this Sub-IR was to change the dynamics at the national level for decentralization.The Program:  Developed a proposal for a municipal tax code and a municipal code;  Introduced a solution for the problem of municipal debt;  Designed a Single-Window for Municipal Projects as the mechanism to improve the coordination of national and municipal public investment; and  Provided legal assistance for the revision of the statutes of national-level municipal associations to reform their reform its governance structure.The indicator for Sub-IR 2.3 was defined as: “Number of Municipalities with Municipal Development Council (COMUDE) Citizen Participation Commissions operating”. Although the target was seven (7) COMUDEs, by the end of the Program 10 COMUDEs had been established and were functioning with the appropriate commissions and committees. Those formed included the participation of municipal authorities and community leaders. These commissions monitored the commitments made by the COMUDE. In addition, the commissions were conceived as a space to improve the quality, not only the number, of women participating. The Program experience suggests that women participate more actively in small groups. Over the course of the four years of field implementation, a total of 22,744 persons participated in training workshops, COMUDEs, and Commissions (not exclusive to Citizen Participation). Of this total, 24.8 percent were women.Sub-IR 2.4., local capacity for the development and implementation of reconstruction program strengthened in the San Marcos Department.At the request of USAID, Sub-IR 2.4 was added to the Program to contribute to the reconstruction process in the Department of San Marcos in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Stan. In the aftermath of Hurricane Stan, DevTech provided technical assistance during a two-year period to 14 municipalities as well as the governor’s office to track and manage rehabilitation projects to ensure their completion, and strengthen the Municipal Planning Offices and COMUDES to take a pro-active role in the process. A tangible outcome was the design of an easy-to-use management information system for monitoring infrastructure projects that can be used at the municipal levels. The Program has worked with the Secretariat of Decentralization (SCEP) to establish a one-stop window for processing municipal investment projects, and also worked with SCEP and Executive Secretariat of Planning and Programming to replicate the program as a model across the country.",

Over the last three years, marketing traffic has increased six fold, while the number of people in markets, the number of commercial vehicle operators, and the number of traders have all more than doubled. The number of tax tickets levied on markets has increased threefold, which clearly indicates an increase in the number of commercial transactions. The volume of agricultural products sold in markets has increased fivefold, and transportation time has decreased to one-sixth of what it was, since the average speed on improved roads has increased from 6 kilometers per hour (kdh) to 35 kdh. As a result, transportation costs have been cut in half for passengers as well as for commodities, and traffic is no longer halted during the rainy season. Villages that were totally cut off are now linked to the outside world year-round.",

At the time of the evaluation, the ALP was implemented in 10 counties by 11 implementing partners.The Evaluation Team dedicated three months in Liberia to assess:  The coverage and impact of the USAID-funded ALPP intervention after 18 months of implementation; and  The relative efficacy and appropriateness of the overall ALP model for students aged 15 and older as implemented by the 11 partner agencies.The evaluation design included classroom observations, focus groups, and student testing.The Evaluation Team traveled to the six counties where ALPP was implemented, visiting a total of 18 school sites and covering the educational programs of the USAID-implemented ALPP, Partner-implemented ALPs, and MoE-run Conventional Primary School Grades 1-6. Data was collected through 39 classroom observations as well as focus groups/interviews that were carried out with a number of stakeholders. These stakeholders included: Ministry of Education personnel, partner organizations, County and District Education Officers, principals, community members, Parent-Teacher Associations, youth groups and students.To assess the learning outcomes of ALP students and determine the overall effectiveness of the program, the Team developed and administered assessment instruments in Mathematics and Language Arts for ALP Levels II and III. The exams were designed to assess proficiency in specific skills such as subtraction, division, use of pronouns, and comprehension. To provide comparative data, the tests were also administered to students in MoE Grades 3 and 5 and to students in ALP partner programs. In total, 806 students were tested by the DevTech team.To complement the evaluation aspects of the assignment, DevTech delivered three capacity building workshops to staff of the implementing partners and other Liberian educators.  The purpose was to increase the capacity of ALP Implementing Partners to develop instructional assessments to collect and use data on ALP student learning outcomes to improve the ability to collect, manage, and analyze data through improved database skills, and to develop a common monitoring tool and reliable database for ALP/ALPP programs.",

        "content"  : "DevTech provided resident, long-term technical assistance on budget reform and institutional strengthening in Ukraine.The project had two phases.Phase IDuring the first 18 months, DevTech assisted the Ministry of Finance to reform its budget process. DevTech provided a Budget Advisor, who helped the Ministry of Finance design and incorporate policies, procedures, and programs that ensured all government ministries develop and execute balanced budgets that reflected their respective short-, medium- and long-term strategies, priorities, and objectives. The Budget Advisor trained various line-ministries and conducted strategic planning while helping to build the capacity of the ministries’ staff with regards to program or performance based budgeting (PPB). DevTech also helped the Ministry of Finance to establish a more effective revenue and expenditures structure that was consistent with the new market economy driven government functions.Phase IIIn 2003, the project shifted focus from federal ministries to the sub-national level. DevTech began promoting fiscal decentralization and equitable allocation of resources, and trained local officials to increase their budgeting and financial management expertise and capabilities. The Senior Budget Advisor, based in Khmelnitsky, became Chief of Party. As such, he assisted local governments in Lviv and Poltava to improve their financial position through PPB, resulting in more autonomy and accountability. DevTech led a nationwide budget training to raion and subraion finance officers, focusing on the opportunities and requirements mandated in Ukraine’s new Budget Code. Three oblasts and their cooperating jurisdictions used PPB for their 2005–2007 budgets, thus demonstrating a capacity to implement improved budgeting approaches. They were then selected to participate in an intense training program with seminars, workshops, and mini-trainings, which served as a PPB Pilot Project to be replicated on a wider scale. DevTech also provided critical technical input into the extension of the Budget Code to lower levels of local government, specifically to subraion levels.",

In the end, however, we believe our contribution should not be limited to an evaluation of the PDE as process. Thus, while we use an analysis of the PDE as a methodological recourse, and we do make certain “process” suggestions, we also make some recommendations regarding the substantive nature of the reforms that are needed.In order to carry out a profound analysis of the roots of the educational problems that have been affecting the Dominican Republic for many years, we applied an eclectic methodological approach that combines traditional empirical analysis with personal accounts of the most important events and conditions. Without the latter element of investigation, albeit informal,we would fall into the trap of a superficial and perfunctory analysis, leaving some critically relevant issues out of the picture simply because they could be controversial, a practice not acceptable in DevTech’s consulting ethics. Unfortunately, the history of public education in Dominican Republic is plagued by decisions and activities that are not entirely transparent to the general public and are conveniently omitted from the analysis of the pusillanimous investigator.",
