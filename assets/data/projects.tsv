The first component involved provision of a long-term, resident senior macroeconomic advisor to MIPPE for policy reform and implementation. This macroeconomist advised on liberalization policies, assisted the government with restoring access to assistance from international financial institutions, and reviewed macroeconomic projections and general economic and business conditions in light of targets of the economic program.

The second component of the project called for short-term technical assistance in specific areas to facilitate the implementation of the economic program. Illustrative short-term technical assistance tasks included:

Financial equilibrium in social security pension plans;
Budget policy and administration;
Reduction and eventual elimination of barriers to free trade;
Privatization;
Elimination of price controls;
Cost analysis of health care services delivered by the government; and
Public-sector investment planning.
This project also continued the public education program to raise the level of economic understanding in support of policy reform initiated during the Immediate Recovery Project.

Working with the Vice-Minister of Finance and Public Credit, DevTech identified problems at the consolidation stage, recommended a common methodology, and reviewed the quality and timeliness of financial data flowing through the budgetary and accounting process. For the consolidation portion of the project, the International Monetary Fund methodology was adapted and merged with the existing coding structure for both revenue and expense. The result was a detailed chart of accounts that accommodated both the budgetary and accounting processes for the central government, decentralized agencies, and public enterprises.

Over the last three years, marketing traffic has increased sixfold, while the number of people in markets, the number of commercial vehicle operators, and the number of traders have all more than doubled. The number of tax tickets levied on markets has increased threefold, which clearly indicates an increase in the number of commercial transactions. The volume of agricultural products sold in markets has increased fivefold, and transportation time has decreased to one-sixth of what it was, since the average speed on improved roads has increased from 6 kilometers per hour (kdh) to 35 kdh. As a result,transportation costs have been cut in half for passengers as well as for commodities, and traffic is no longer halted during the rainy season.

Decentralization and Local Governance;
Public Financial Management; and
Trade and Competitiveness.
Work orders were issued under the contract to perform economic studies, prepare and/or arrange for the preparation of seminars on economic topics, conduct in-country training, and provide related technical assistance to private- and public-sector entities.

DevTech completed 31 work orders and prepared several significant technical publications, highlighted below.

Decentralization and Local Governance

Fiscal Reform: Reviewed the overall public finances of El Salvador, including several issues related to financing municipal transfers. DevTech assistance focused on how the transfer system (FODES ��_ Fondo de Desarrollo Econ��_mico Social) addressed horizontal inequality, its impact on local revenue effort, and the slow implementation/usage rate by local governments. Recommendations were made to improve the incentive aspects to encourage local revenue effort and to improve the programming of transfers to better meet implementation cycles. This included not only analytical work and setting an agenda for reform, but also making several presentations, including to the Budget and Municipal Affairs Committees of the Legislative Assembly. DevTech's presentation was aired on television and radio and appeared on the front page of the country��_s main newspaper.
Municipal Tax Reform: Provided technical assistance and advisory services to the Municipal Affairs Committee of the Legislative Assembly and worked closely with the Mayors��_ organization, COMURES, in conducting a dialogue with the private sector. Sub-tasks included: preparing a guideline to facilitate the Legislative Assembly��_s review and qualification of municipal tax proposed legislation; developing analytical techniques for assessing the impact of local tax law changes on industry and municipal revenues, and its application; development of model legislation; developing a proposed agenda for municipal finance system reform; advising the new Government��_s transition team on municipal finance system reform; and assisting the Legislative Assembly in the development of property tax and other municipal tax legislation.
Municipal Finance. Assisted the municipalities of San Salvador and Sonsonate in the analysis of options for private sector participation in municipal infrastructure investment. This included economic, financial, and regulatory aspects of BOO BOT. DevTech also conducted a seminar on private sector participation in municipal infrastructure investment.
Municipal Finance (Asset Tax): Assisted the municipal government of San Salvador in the proposal and defense of an important reform of its asset tax. This included developing alternative scenarios and revenue projections, reclassifying municipal finance data in the IMF Government Finance Statistics format, participating in discussions with the private sector on the need for the reform, and supporting the municipal government in defending its position.
Municipal Finance. Assisted the municipalities of San Salvador with analytical and legal issues related to the first bond issuance.
Public Financial Management

Examined El Salvador��_s public-sector budget and made recommendations regarding taxation, spending, subsidies, and transparency. This public sector review was presented in a seminar to the Budget Committee of the Legislative Assembly.
Established the Office of Budget Analysis and Oversight in the Legislative Assembly and trained the staff.
Provided advisory assistance to the Ministry of Hacienda on tax administration. Reported on use of computerized data systems, tax administration, tax personnel, tax code, and other non-policy aspects of the tax system.
Trade and Competitiveness

Trade Capacity Building. Strengthened the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Economy Office of Export Market Promotion to assist local El Salvador clients in expanding their sales into international markets. Technical advisory assistance included: a) assessments of how units of the Ministry could be better organized and coordinated in support of the national competitive program; b) skills development in conducting research to collect international country, market and product intelligence; and c) team building to enhance the effectiveness of staff working in the three Ministry offices implementing the program. 
Competition (Micro, small and medium sized enterprises). In the aftermath of the earthquakes of early 2001, a DevTech team conducted an assessment of how to reactivate the economy, including examining the expansion of credit for housing, enterprises, and other financing instruments; evaluating priority actions to stimulate the growth of enterprises, particularly micro, small, and medium sized enterprises using non-credit instruments, with particular emphasis on the use of private business associations, business development organizations, NGOs, and other intermediaries that can work with enterprises on a fee for service basis; and other possible policy interventions. 
Assisted the Mission��_s efforts to clarify performance indicators in education, micro-finance, and policy. DevTech also helped the Mission refine its system for measuring and monitoring rural policy. 
Supported the USAID Mission in El Salvador in crafting an updated agriculture and rural development assistance strategy for the country."	Link 	Jorge Pena 	mott@usaid.gov	"(503) 2-98-1666, fax 2-98-0885

The criteria assume that each particular activity is worth doing, but consider the implications for broadly-based economic growth versus economic growth itself, the probability of change taking place even if USAID does not fund it, and the relative merits of IFC versus USAID assistance.

The rest of the paper elaborates upon the concepts of investor protections and  creditor
protections, discussing their link to an economic concentration of financial assets and their importance in explaining stock market size. Countries offer different investor and creditor protections - often in response to their particular legal tradition - and the result is typically different evolutionary paths for financial markets. Analysis of the data shows that the presence of about half the possible investor protections is associated with larger stock market capitalizations, but that the presence of more protections than that is not associated with increases in capitalization."

218	Education Reform Evaluation in the Dominican Republic			2000	2000	"Latin America and
Caribbean"	Dominican Republic	USAID					x			"In 1990, the Dominican Republic embarked on a process of basic education reform with the consensus of civil society organizations and the Government of the Dominican Republic. The debates led to a comprehensive 10-year reform plan��_the Plan Decenal��_begun in 1992.

Through a task order under the Evaluation IQC, DevTech conducted an external evaluation of the Plan Decenal's achievements. The evaluation's main goal was to provide guidelines for a new stage of the reform process. DevTech presented an objective and critical assessment of the reforms in order to involve all sectors of the Dominican population in the development of a second Plan Decenal. The evaluation found that, while the education sector continued to suffer from under-development, there was promise in public-private partnerships in the education sector. 

The evaluation identified eight principles for educational reform:

Principle No. 1: Education cannot be improved by trying to change everything at the same time. A feasible reform program (vis-��_-vis the theoretically optimal one) should concentrate on achieving a few critical goals and advance from there in successive stages.
Principle No. 2: Education reform with the depth the Dominican Republic needs cannot be achieved during the tenure of one government administration. In fact, the necessary changes may require the consistent effort of several administrations from different political parties. That is why a successful reform program must be non-partisan and consensus-driven, though we are strongly of the opinion that a consensus base is not enough; the reform also has to be sensible (e.g., it cannot assume the equivalent of the Earth being flat).
Principle No. 3: Good management does not come from authority, political power, or hierarchy. Good management is an advanced skill and cannot be improvised or achieve by appointing trusted aides. Education reform is a highly complex and involved process that requires top quality managers. If they are not available, it should be imported on the same basis that technical assistance and external resources are being brought from external sources.
Principle No. 4: Reform goals must be achievable with the resources currently available under a hard budget constraint. If those targets are below what the Dominican economy and society at large require, more resources must be made available. If the targets overshoot their possibilities, they will contribute to disorganize the effort and make it fail.
Principle No. 5: As a corollary to Principle 1, a given improvement of a reform program cannot be implemented equally in all institutions at the same time. As the reform effort advances, there will be inequalities of implementation simply because some agents are more skillful than others, but this should not be an impediment to the advance of the reforms.
Principle No. 6: At least some of the proposed solutions should ideally be administratively feasible in the Dominican Republic, by the Dominican state, as it exists today. It should not be necessary to assume a state that is more administratively capable than currently exists, in order to implement all of the project��_s points. Some points in the project should be implementable even if there is no improvement whatever in the administrative capacity of the state.
Principle No. 7: One should start from the final goal and reason back. The final goal is for children to have more access to schooling and to learn more. Everything else is an intermediate goal.
Principle No. 8: Improving capacity (e.g., improving capacity of principals to manage, or teachers to teach), without creating accountability mechanisms to create incentives to use that capacity is largely useless unless one is willing to make the unwarrantedly romantic assumption that teachers and principals will work hard and, just for love of the craft. However, to create accountability pressure mechanisms without also expanding the personal and institutional supply capacity is also largely useless since there is nothing with which to respond to the accountability pressure.
The end product of DevTech's technical assistance served as input for a strategic planning exercise that the future Minister had requested and consisted of an initial diagnosis, policies and strategies, provincial planning, and pilot project design.

The evaluation was widely cited at the time and utilized as a key input into the planning process of the government."	The future of education in Dominican Republic : opportunities and challenges��_

The objectives of the assessment were to provide a rigorous review of the impact of USAID's investment in civil society; share input to help the Mission shape its next five-year strategy (2002��_2007); and draw key lessons learned and best practices from USAID/DR's activities to promote the development of a politically active civil society in support of democracy.

As part of this assessment, the team:

Interviewed 187 key individuals in local and national government using semi-structured protocols;
Conducted 22 focus groups throughout the country with PID sub-grantees and PC electoral observers;
Conducted a nationwide survey of PID beneficiaries and PC electoral observers on values and practices of individuals and community groups related to democracy and civil society. The data from the nation-wide survey was then cross-analyzed to draw conclusions about the impact of program activities.
The Assessment team concluded that there were several key factors critical to the success of implementing a program to strengthen civil society in the Dominican Republic. These were:

Civil Society Programs require a long-term strategy. USAID/DR's foresight to support the initiative over a 10-year period was critical. It provided the necessary time to build the projects carefully, let them take hold, and eventually reach out to a broad and receptive public. Changing political culture needs at least a decade.
One step behind approach is critical. An essential part of the strategy to promote democracy in the DR was to maintain a low profile, allowing the Dominican grantees to take the visible lead in pushing for democratic reforms. This one step behind strategy conferred legitimacy and credibility to the effort as a Dominican initiative and was key to its success.
Flexibility. Given the fluidity of the political situation in the DR, it was essential for the USAID Mission to support a ""demand"" rather than a ""supply"" driven initiative. This approach helped to build momentum and contributed to the sustainability of the initiative"	Assessment of USAID civil society programs in the Dominican Republic��_	Office	checchi@checchiconsulting.com	202-466-9070

The project had two phases.

Phase I

During the first 18 months, DevTech assisted the Ministry of Finance to reform its budget process. DevTech provided a Budget Advisor, who helped the Ministry of Finance design and incorporate policies, procedures, and programs that ensured all government ministries develop and execute balanced budgets that reflected their respective short-, medium- and long-term strategies, priorities, and objectives. The Budget Advisor trained various line-ministries and conducted strategic planning while helping to build the capacity of the ministries��_ staff with regards to program or performance based budgeting (PPB). DevTech also helped the Ministry of Finance to establish a more effective revenue and expenditures structure that was consistent with the new market economy driven government functions.

Phase II

In 2003, the project shifted focus from federal ministries to the sub-national level. DevTech began promoting fiscal decentralization and equitable allocation of resources, and trained local officials to increase their budgeting and financial management expertise and capabilities. The Senior Budget Advisor, based in Khmelnytsky, became Chief of Party. As such, he assisted local governments in Lviv and Poltava to improve their financial position through PPB, resulting in more autonomy and accountability. DevTech led a nationwide budget training to raion and subraion finance officers, focusing on the opportunities and requirements mandated in Ukraine��_s new Budget Code. Three oblasts and their cooperating jurisdictions used PPB for their 2005��_2007 budgets, thus demonstrating a capacity to implement improved budgeting approaches. They were then selected to participate in an intense training program with seminars, workshops, and mini-trainings, which served as a PPB Pilot Project to be replicated on a wider scale. DevTech also provided critical technical input into the extension of the Budget Code to lower levels of local government, specifically to subraion levels.

The BPS Project's goal was to help the GFRN solidify institutional roles in the budget preparation process and establish a multi-year budgeting capability. The project provided technical assistance and training in the areas of planning processes, budget preparation and formulation, budget execution, and organizational development. DevTech provided technical assistance in organizational development to the Budget Office of the Federation (BOF) in the Ministry of Finance and to the Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence (BMPI) Unit of the Office of the President.

The BOF was divided into several departments that had historically functioned as separate entities, with little understanding or incentive for aligning each department under a unifying overall objective, resulting in inefficiency, mismanagement, and unclear roles. Thus, DevTech conducted a participatory analysis of the departments, and then helped them to clearly define their respective roles in the budget process regarding the overall BOF strategic plan. Following this exercise, DevTech helped BOF staff develop departmental objectives that were in alignment with the overall BOF objectives, with measurable performance indicators built into each objective. DevTech staff also provided input into the development of a training program.

The BMPI unit was responsible for ensuring that the Office of the President was fully informed about the budgetary process at three levels:

Budget Formulation��_providing a pool of experts and a Price Intelligence Database (PID) tool to ensure accuracy and authenticity of expenditure proposals submitted by various governmental units;
Budget Prioritization��_establishing the strategic and planning priorities for future allocation of resources; and
Budget Execution��_enhancing the efficiency and the effectiveness of programs and service delivery as well as the overall management of resources.
The BMPI Unit's staff members were mostly contract hires and the BMPI Unit Director planned to have these positions and these staff ""regularized"" into the civil service, as full-time staff.

To help the BMPI Unit achieve its goals, DevTech assessed consultants' contracts and assisted with planning for the transition of consultancies to full-time staff. DevTech staff reviewed the consultants' perceptions regarding their work with the BMPI vis-��_-vis their career development targets; identified factors that inhibit and stimulate the staff in their current roles, and incentives that would make employment more attractive; and provided a methodology to regularize the consulting staff of the BMPI within the civil service structure, upon full-time enrollment. DevTech also conducted an evaluation of existing skills of personnel and identified additional skills required of sector specialists and training needs; helped BMPI staff define personnel job descriptions and create a nomenclature of compensation; identified ways to attract additional expertise into the BMPI Unit; identified a transition strategy for departing staff (sector specialists) and new hires; defined recruitment procedures for new hires; and reviewed and developed organizational performance, standards of performance, appraisal, and teamwork."

>Assessed the state of intergovernmental relations, including distribution of revenues, spending, etc., and the legal framework for the federal and state constitutions and local government law;
>Trained members of the Commission in transfer systems, assignment of roles and responsibilities, service delivery models and best practices based on international experience;
>Designed and supervised a variety of technical studies; and
>Organized a seminar to review these studies and to arrive at a consensus on the future of fiscal federalism.

DevTech helped the Instituto para el Desarrollo T��_cnico de las Haciendas P��_blicas (INDETEC) publish these studies in a single volume book titled: Enfoques Alternativos del Federalismo Fiscal en M��_xico (Alternative Foci for Fiscal Federalism in Mexico).

This final work represented a broad consensus for reform, endorsed by the major players, but based on solid technical analysis. The broad distribution and discussion of this book helped ensure that these issues would start to rise to the top of the political and legislative agenda.

302	Combating Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic			2003	2007	Caribbean 	Dominican Republic	U.S. Department of Labor	CARE	x	944301		x			"In 2003, the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) signed a cooperative agreement with DevTech to implement the Combating Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic project. The program works worked with the International Labor Organization, the Dominican Secretariats of Education and Labor, and other stakeholders to:

Raise awareness of the importance of education for all children and to mobilize a wide array of actors to improve and expand education infrastructures;
Strengthen formal and transitional education systems that encourage working children and those at risk of working to attend school;
Strengthen national institutions and policies on education and child labor; and
Ensure the long-term sustainability of these efforts.
The Dominican Republic's Secretariat of Labor defined the ""worst forms of child labor"" (WFCL) as hazardous work in agriculture, dangerous urban work in streets or sweatshops, domestic servants, child trafficking, and commercial sexual exploitation. When the Dominican Government ratified ILO Convention 182, it committed to take immediate and effective measures to eliminate the WFCL within 10 years. Within this framework, as well as the USDOL's objectives, this project's goal was to reduce the number of children involved in WFCL by 4,200��_commercial sexual exploitation (450), informal urban economy (850), and dangerous agriculture (2,900)��_over a four-year period. Targeted children included those who either dropped out of school or attended school irregularly, with the latter group repeating grades or ropping out of school altogether. About 5,600 children benefitted from this program.

Project Interventions

The Combating Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic project addressed three main areas: creating a complete educational program for ""the other shift,"" or the other half-day; making school more relevant and attractive by providing teachers and administrators with special training and supervision; and providing vocational education to adolescents who opted out of regular schooling.

Espacios Para Crecer (""Spaces for Growth"")

DevTech and its partners developed an education program to ensure regular school attendance bychildren in the 6-14 age group (the targed age range for the project). The project team created Espacios para Crecer (Spaces for Growth) ��_ a high-quality, well-structured program with three basic components: academic leveling (focusing on math, reading, and writing), recreation (physical education, music, theater, art, and literature), and life skills.

Attendance records indicated that over 95 percent of the targeted children attended both regular school and the Espacios para Crecer program daily, and were promoted both during and at the end of the school year. 

Teacher Training

The project also focused on the teachers of the targeted children. A three-day training course in Quantum Learning methodology was delivered to 500 educators and administrators.

After the first training course to 160 educators (financed with project funds), the Dominican Secretariat of Education was so impressed that it financed courses for 240 teachers and administrators, while Plan International, an NGO, financed courses for 100 more teachers.

Vocational Education

The vocational training program targeting adolescents (14��_17 years old) presented challenges since vocational education institutions in the Dominican Republic require a basic education (8th grade) certificate for admission and very few of the targeted adolescents had completed 8th grade.

The project team identified several institutions that were willing to offer programs to these adolescents. For example, a private institution in Santiago trained 33 adolescents in pastry making, commercial sewing (tailoring), and basic computer skills. A private vocational school in Santo Domingo offered a special program for 80 adolescents during a six-week summer session. One rural school with a small computer lab provided computer skills training for adolescents in that community. In the beach community of Sos��_a, 30 young women completed a six-month training course for beauty salon assistants. The project also adapted a program for micro-enterprise training that was taught to a group of adolescents and their parents in the beach community of Las Terrenas.

Sustainability

To ensure the sustainability of the program, DevTech and its partners created a consortium to continue the operation of existing EpCs and advance improvements in education. The consortium has become a strong network of Dominican and U.S.-based organizations and has received support from multiple sources, including the Dominican Secretariat of Education, among others.

Also, the EpC program has been replicated by DevTech and other organizations in communities in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Colombia.

In 2007, the EpC program and the activities of DevTech and its partners received additional funding (through 2011) from the U.S. Department of Labor. Please see Combating Exploitative Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic for more information.

This pioneering, evidence-based initiative was designed to reduce school-related gender-based violence (SRGBV), improve educational outcomes, and reduce negative health outcomes. Program interventions were implemented in schools in the two countries and focused on students ranging in age from approximately 10 to 14.

DevTech was the prime contractor for this pilot project for USAID. In both countries, DevTech fully collaborated with civil society and community organizations to develop local capacity to design, implement, and monitor and evaluate SRGBV prevention interventions and their impact so that gender safety could become the norm in schools. The program also worked with stakeholders on the national and institutional level to provide training and raise awareness of SRGBV so that these actors could assist those on the community and individual levels. The final product of the Safe Schools program was a series of three global Doorways training manuals (students, community counselors, and teachers) and country-specific materials still in use. These materials were also translated into several different languages and are used in other countries across the globe.

The Safe Schools project demonstrates the benefit of using evidence-based, collaborative approaches, as well as DevTech's dedication to true capacity-building. DevTech is proud that other organizations are using these materials developed with American taxpayer money to reduce gender-based violence in schools.

Save the Children, Plan International, and the Malawian YouthNet and Counselling (YONECO) are among several international organizations that have adopted and implemented the Safe Schools training materials to continue to address school violence in Malawi, and in programs in other countries, including Haiti and Senegal. In addition, USAID has translated the Safe Schools training materials into Arabic, Russian, French, and Spanish, and has posted them on its website.

The manuals and other interventions have been used throughout the program at each of the following levels:

Individual level

The Doorways Student Training Manual utilizes a children's rights approach and gender approach to teaching children about appropriate gender relations. Based on the results of the program endline survey, the piloting of the manual was successful at increasing students' knowledge of, and changing their attitudes regarding, SRGBV. The classroom program was complemented with additional interventions such as theater for development, radio, gender clubs, after-school programs, and assemblies. An excellent example of the children applying what they learned can be viewed on a video entitled: Mister Speaker, Sir.

Community level

The Doorways Community Counselors Training Manual provides resources at the community level to identify and refer cases of school-related gender-based violence to service providers.

Institutional level

The Doorways Teachers Training Manual provides training for education professionals on SRGBV awareness, prevention, reporting, and referral. The program endline survey confirmed that after receiving the training, teachers had changed their attitudes about their role in preventing SRGBV and how to apply the Teachers' Code of Conduct. In addition, improved and consolidated Codes of Conduct were developed in both pilot countries by the respective teachers' unions and education ministries.

National level

An Advocates Network was formed to raise awareness of SRGBV among key stakeholders and government officials. Also, a series of campaign posters was developed in each country.

DevTech provided technical assistance in municipalities and coordinated assistance for national-level institutions to improve the capacity to support decentralization. In two cases, contract results were modified mid-course due to changes in Government of Guatemala requirements for municipalities. DevTech conducted the necessary technical analysis to adjust the program activities and re-target assistance. DevTech also helped the Governor of the San Marcos Department establish a system for municipalities to implement reconstruction activities and monitor reconstruction projects in the aftermath of Hurricane Stan.

DevTech incorporated an integrated performance monitoring system for its work at the local government level, which includes indicators for more than 20 lower-level results, and data collection (baseline and yearly) in 15 municipalities. The system served as a basis for establishing indicators of municipal development and guided program activities.

The Program had four Sub-Intermediate Results (IR):

Sub-IR 2.1 More transparent systems for management of public resources by local governments
Sub-IR 2.2 Increased devolution of responsibilities and resources to the local level resulting in greater responsiveness by local governments to citizens' needs
Sub-IR 2.3 More opportunities for citizen participation in and oversight of local government decision-making
Sub-IR 2.4 Local capacity for the development and implementation of reconstruction program strengthened in the San Marcos Department. 
 Sub-IR 2.1. More Transparent Systems for Management of Public Resources

This Sub-IR indicator measured the improvement in the fiscal performance of the selected municipalities. For the 13 selected Program municipalities, intergovernmental transfers were, on average, 92 percent of total revenues in 2008. The annual rate of growth of own-source revenues for the 13 selected municipalities increased from -0.5 percent in 2005 to 41.2 percent in 2008. Technical assistance was delivered through three mechanisms:

Updating the municipal fees schedules;
Improving operating regulations and collection of fees for municipal services; and
Strengthening policies to reduce the avoidance of the payment of municipal services
In addition to the improvement in revenue collection, the Program successfully strengthened the public financial management systems at the municipal level. These included a public procurement system, financial management system, auditing units, and internal controls. In the base year of 2005, the average score for the 13 municipalities was 31 out of 100 points. When the Program closed in September 2009, the average had increased to 89 out of 100 points.

Sub-IR 2.2. Increased devolution of responsibilities and greater responsiveness to citizen needs 

The focus of the activities in this Sub-IR was to change the dynamics at the national level for decentralization. The Program:

Developed a proposal for a municipal tax code and a municipal code;
Introduced a solution for the problem of municipal debt;
Designed a Single-Window for Municipal Projects as the mechanism to improve the coordination of national and municipal public investment; and
Provided legal assistance for the revision of the statutes of national-level municipal associations to reform their reform its governance structure. 
Sub-IR 2.3. More opportunities for citizen participation in and oversight of local government decision-making

The indicator for Sub-IR 2.3 was defined as: ��_Number of Municipalities with Municipal Development Council (COMUDE) Citizen Participation Commissions operating��_. Although the target was seven (7) COMUDEs, by the end of the Program 10 COMUDEs had been established and were functioning with the appropriate commissions and committees. Those formed included the participation of municipal authorities and community leaders. These commissions monitored the commitments made by the COMUDE. In addition, the commissions were conceived as a space to improve the quality, not only the number, of women participating. The Program experience suggests that women participate more actively in small groups. Over the course of the four years of field implementation, a total of 22,744 persons participated in training workshops, COMUDEs, and Commissions (not exclusive to Citizen Participation). Of this total, 24.8 percent were women.

Sub-IR 2.4. Local capacity for the development and implementation of reconstruction program strengthened in the San Marcos Department.

At the request of USAID, Sub-IR 2.4 was added to the Program to contribute to the reconstruction process in the Department of San Marcos in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Stan. In the aftermath of Hurricane Stan, DevTech provided technical assistance during a two-year period to 14 municipalities as well as the governor��_s office to track and manage rehabilitation projects to ensure their completion, and strengthen the Municipal Planning Offices and COMUDES to take a pro-active role in the process. A tangible outcome was the design of an easy-to-use management information system for monitoring infrastructure projects that can be used at the municipal levels. The Program has worked with the Secretariat of Decentralization (SCEP) to establish a one-stop window for processing municipal investment projects, and also worked with SCEP and Executive Secretariat of Planning and Programming to replicate the program as a model across the country.

This grant is a direct reflection of the success of the DevTech project, Combating Child Labor through Education in the Dominican Republic, completed in 2007. In association with two Dominican organizations and a number of local subcontractors, DevTech built upon the successes of the last project and introduced new innovations to offer Dominican youth an alternative to exploitative child labor.

This project aimed to prevent or withdraw 10,000 Dominican youths (7,500 children and 2,500 adolescents) from exploitative child labor by scaling up the educational models introduced in the first project and introducing new programs to provide educational alternatives to adolescents.

 Espacios Para Crecer (""Spaces for Growth"")

A major component of this project was the continuation of the ""Espacios para Crecer"" (EpC) model introduced in the previous project. In the Dominican Republic, the overcrowding of schools necessitates a shift system where half of the students attend school during a morning shift, and half during an afternoon shift. The EpCs provide a second shift of non-formal education that complements the Dominican national curriculum. This project saw the opening of new EpCs in various regions throughout the Dominican Republic. The facilitators of these new EpCs received training in Quantum Learning��_ methodology. 

Funding provided by the United States Department of Labor under cooperative agreement E-9-K-3-0054 financed the development of the EpC materials.

The Espacios Para Emprender (""Spaces for Entrepreneurship"") Model

The cornerstone of this project was the introduction of a vocational training program geared toward adolescents. 

The goal of the ""Espacios para Emprender"" (EpEs) is to help out-of-school youth gain marketable skills through compensatory education programming. Specifically, volunteer facilitators who serve as counselors guide the adolescents toward vocational training programs based on their desired careers. The EpE program also provides job placement support to adolescents."	Link

The relative efficacy and appropriateness of the overall ALP model for students aged 15 and older as implemented by the 11 partner agencies.
The evaluation design included classroom observations, focus groups, and student testing.

The Evaluation Team traveled to the six counties where ALPP was implemented, visiting a total of 18 school sites and covering the educational programs of the USAID-implemented ALPP, Partner-implemented ALPs, and MoE-run Conventional Primary School Grades 1-6. Data was collected through 39 classroom observations as well as focus groups/interviews that were carried out with a number of stakeholders, which included: Ministry of Education personnel, partner organizations, County and District Education Officers, principals, community members, Parent-Teacher Associations, youth groups and students.

To assess the learning outcomes of ALP students and determine the overall effectiveness of the program, the Team developed and administered assessment instruments in Mathematics and Language Arts for ALP Levels II and III. The exams were designed to assess proficiency in specific skills such as subtraction, division, use of pronouns, and comprehension. To provide comparative data, the tests were also administered to students in MoE Grades 3 and 5 and to students in ALP partner programs. In total, 806 students were tested by the DevTech team.

To complement the evaluation aspects of the assignment, DevTech delivered three capacity building workshops to staff of the implementing partners and other Liberian educators.  The purpose was to increase the capacity of ALP Implementing Partners to develop instructional assessments to collect and use data on ALP student learning outcomes to improve the ability to collect, manage, and analyze data through improved database skills, and to develop a common monitoring tool and reliable database for ALP/ALPP programs."

During this four-year period, USAID launched an ambitious effort called USAID Forward, which aims to integrate all aspects of the Agency��_s programming approach, including program and project evaluations, into a modern, evidence-based system for realizing development results. A key element of this initiative is USAID��_s Evaluation Policy, released in January 2011.
Meta-Evaluation Questions
The meta-evaluation on which this volume reports systematically examined 340 randomly selected evaluations and gathered qualitative data from USAID staff and evaluators to address three questions:
1. To what degree have quality aspects of USAID��_s evaluation reports, and underlying practices, changed over time?
2. At this point in time, on which evaluation quality aspects or factors do USAID��_s evaluation reports excel and where are they falling short?
3. What can be determined about the overall quality of USAID evaluation reports and where do the greatest opportunities for improvement lie?"	Meta-evaluation of quality and coverage of USAID evaluations 2009-2012��_

Program on Rights and Justice II (PRAJ II), currently being implemented by the East-West Management Institute (EWMI). The program began its first course in 2003 (as PRAJ I). Beginning in 2008, PRAJ II (a US $20 million program) has focused on civil society strengthening. Originally scheduled to close in September 2013, PRAJ II has been extended one year (with an additional two million dollars of funding).
The dual purpose of the evaluation was to: 1) Provide critical information to USAID/Cambodia to
inform the design and strategy of its next generation of Democracy and Governance (DG)
programming; and 2) Develop the capacity of USAID staff in the field of evaluation by including them as members of the evaluation team. The approach to this internal evaluation emerged out of a
USAID/Washington, Policy, Planning, and Learning Bureau/ Learning, Evaluation and Research Office
(PPL/LER) initiative to build USAID staff capacity to better commission, manage and use evaluations by conducting one as part of an evaluation team."
